# GrowthBook Node.js SDK

[GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io) is a modular Feature Flagging and Experimentation platform.

This is the Node.js client library that lets you evaluate feature flags and run experiments (A/B tests) within a Node.js application. It is a thin wrapper around the [Javascript SDK](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/js), so you might want to view those docs first to familiarize yourself with the basic classes and methods.
