# API

The Growth Book API is pretty easy to integrate into any tech stack.

To get started, on the Growth Book settings page, generate an API key.

As of right now, there is only a single public API endpoint: `/config/{apiKey}`.  If you are using Growth Book Cloud (https://app.growthbook.io), the endpoint is accessible from our global CDN: https://cdn.growthbook.io/config/{apiKey}.  

This returns configuration info for every experiment. 
It can be passed directly into our client libraries or you can use the info to implement your own variation assignment and targeting.

Here is an example API response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "overrides": {
    "experiment-key": {
      "status": "running",
      "weights": [0.5, 0.5],
      "coverage": 1,
      "groups": ["beta"],
      "url": "^/post/[0-9]+$"
    },
    "another-experiment": {
      "status": "stopped",
      "force": 2
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field just mirrors the HTTP status code.

The `overrides` field has one entry per experiment with overrides that should take precedence over hard-coded values in your code.

-  **status** - Either "draft", "running", or "stopped".  Stopped experiments are only included in the response if a non-control variation won.
-  **weights** - How traffic should be weighted between variations. Will add up to 1.
-  **coverage** - A float from 0 to 1 (inclusive) which specifies what percent of users to include in the experiment.
-  **groups** - An array of user groups who are eligible for the experiment
-  **url** - A regex for which URLs the experiment should run on
-  **force** - Force all users to see the specified variation index (`0` = control, `1` = first variation, etc.).
