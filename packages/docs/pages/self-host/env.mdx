# Environment Variables

The default configuration in GrowthBook is optimized for trying things out quickly on a local dev machine. Beyond that, you can customize behavior with Environment Variables.

## Domains and Ports

This is used to generate links to GrowthBook and enable CORS access to the API.

- **APP_ORIGIN** - default http://localhost:3000
- **API_HOST** - default http://localhost:3100

If you want to run GrowthBook on a different host than localhost, you need to add the above environment
variables to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
growthbook:
  ...
  environment:
    - APP_ORIGIN=http://<my ip>:3000
    - API_HOST=http://<my ip>:3100
```

If you need to change the ports on your local dev environment (e.g. if `3000` is already being used),
you need to update the above variables AND change the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
growthbook:
  ports:
    - "4000:3000" # example: use 4000 instead of 3000 for the app
    - "4100:3100" # example: use 4100 instead of 3100 for the api
  ...
  environment:
    - APP_ORIGIN=http://<my ip or url>:4000
    - API_HOST=http://<my ip or url>:4100
```

### Production Settings

- **NODE_ENV** - Set to "production" to turn on additional optimizations and API request logging
- **MONGODB_URI** - The MongoDB connection string
- **JWT_SECRET** - Auth signing key (use a long random string)
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY** - Data source credential encryption key (use a long random string)

  When using GrowthBook in production, it is important to change the{" "}
  <code>NODE_ENV</code> to to "production" and change the{" "}
  <code>JWT_SECRET</code> to a random string. Using the <code>production</code>{" "}
  node environment and the default <code>JWT_SECRET</code> will throw an error.

## Email SMTP Settings

This is required in order to send experiment alerts, team member invites, and reset password emails.

- **EMAIL_ENABLED** ("true" or "false")
- **EMAIL_HOST**
- **EMAIL_PORT**
- **EMAIL_HOST_USER**
- **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**
- **EMAIL_FROM**

## Google OAuth Settings

Only required if using Google Analytics as a data source

- **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID**
- **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET**

## File Uploads

The **UPLOAD_METHOD** environment variable controls where to store uploaded files
and screenshots. The supported values are `local`, `s3`, and `google-cloud`.

### local

This is the default value. Uploads are stored in the GrowthBook docker container at
`/usr/local/src/app/packages/back-end/uploads`. In production, you should mount a volume here to persist uploads across container restarts.

### s3

Store uploads in an AWS S3 bucket.

- **S3_BUCKET**
- **S3_REGION** (defaults to `us-east-1`)
- **S3_DOMAIN** (defaults to `https://${S3_BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/`)
- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** (not required when deployed to AWS with an instance role)
- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** (not required when deployed to AWS with an instance role)

### google-cloud

Store uploads in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

- **GCS_BUCKET_NAME**
- **GCS_DOMAIN** (defaults to `https://storage.googleapis.com/${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}/`)
- **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** (not required when deployed to GCP with an instance service account)

## Enterprise Settings

Some features in self-hosted GrowthBook are only available with an Enterprise licence key. Reach out to [sales@growthbook.io](mailto:sales@growthbook.io) to learn more.

- **LICENCE_KEY** - Your signed licence key provided by the GrowthBook team
- **SSO_CONFIG** - A JSON-encoded string that configures SSO (using OpenID Connect). It should be an object with the following keys:
  - `clientId` (string)
  - `clientSecret` (string)
  - `emailDomain` (string, optional) - Allow auto-joining from a specified email domain
  - `metadata` (object)
    - `issuer` (string)
    - `authorization_endpoint` (string)
    - `jwks_uri` (string)
    - `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` (array of strings)
    - `token_endpoint` (string)
    - `code_challenge_methods_supported` (array of strings)
    - `logout_endpoint` (string, optional)
  - `extraQueryParams` (object, optional) - Dictionary of extra query params to be passed along with the `/authorize` OAuth call
  - `additionalScope` (string, optional) - Additional scopes to include, along with the default value: `openid profile email`

For SSO, make sure the following callback URL is whitelisted:

- `{APP_ORIGIN}/oauth/callback`

For the best SSO user experience, enable offline access and refresh tokens in your Identity Provder.

## Other Settings

- **EXPERIMENT_REFRESH_FREQUENCY** - Default update schedule for experiment results. Update when stale for X hours (default `6`).
- **QUERY_CACHE_TTL_MINS** - How long (in minutes) to cache and re-use SQL query results (default `60`)
- **DEFAULT_CONVERSION_WINDOW_HOURS** - How many hours after being put into an experiment does a user have to convert. Can be overridden on a per-metric basis. (default `72`)
- **DISABLE_TELEMETRY** - We collect anonymous telemetry data to help us improve GrowthBook. Set to "true" to disable.
