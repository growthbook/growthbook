# Self Hosting Growth Book

Growth Book consists of a NextJS front-end, an ExpressJS API, and a Python stats engine. Everything is bundled together in a single [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/growthbook/growthbook).

In addition to the app itself, you will also need a MongoDB instance to store login credentials, cached experiment results, and metadata.

## Installation

You can use **docker-compose** to get started quickly:

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  mongo:
    image: "mongo:latest"
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  growthbook:
    image: "growthbook/growthbook:latest"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "3100:3100"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:password@mongo:27017/
```

Then, just run `docker-compose up -d` to start everything and view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Volumes

If you are not using S3 for file uploads, they are stored locally in `/usr/local/src/app/packages/back-end/uploads`. We recommend mounting a volume there so images can be persisted.

Also, if you are running MongoDB through Docker, you will need to mount a volume to `/data/db` to persist data between container restarts. In production, we highly suggest just using a hosted solution like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) instead.

### Commands

These are the possible commands you can use:

- `["yarn", "start"]` - default, start both front-end and back-end in parallel
- `["yarn", "workspace", "front-end", "run"]` - run only the front-end
- `["yarn", "workspace", "back-end", "run"]` - run only the back-end

## Docker Tags

Builds are published automatically from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) main branch.

The most recent commit is tagged with `latest`. GitHub Releases are also tagged (e.g. `0.2.1`).

If you need to reference the image for a specific git commit for any reason, you can use the git shorthash tag (e.g. `git-41278e9`).

### Updating to Latest

If you are using docker-compose, you can update with:

```bash
docker-compose pull growthbook
docker-compose stop growthbook
docker-compose up -d --no-deps growthbook
```
