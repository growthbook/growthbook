# BigQuery Data Source

BigQuery is a managed database that runs on Google Cloud.

## Connection Info

You must first create a Service Account in Google with the proper permissions. To connect Growth Book, we just need the JSON key file for that account.
It should contain the project_id, client_email, and private_key.

Growth Book only runs SELECT queries, but we still recommend only granting read access to the service account.  Always better to be on the safe side.
