# Data Sources

Data Sources are how Growth Book connects to your analytics tool or data warehouse to automatically pull metrics and experiment results.

You can use Growth Book without a Data Source, but the user experience is not as smooth since you must enter all data manually.

Below are the currently supported Data Sources:

-  [Redshift](/sources/redshift)
-  [Snowflake](/sources/snowflake)
-  [BigQuery](/sources/bigquery)
-  [AWS Athena](/sources/athena)
-  [Postgres](/sources/postgres)
-  [Mixpanel](/sources/mixpanel)
-  [Google Analytics](/sources/ga)

## SQL Configuration Settings

For data sources that use SQL, there are a bunch of configuration settings that describe the shape of your data so Growth Book can query effectively.

The default settings assume you are using Segment to populate your database, but everything is customizeable if that's not the case.

- Defaults
  -  **timestamp column** - The default timestamp column for all tables
  -  **user id column** - The default column that stores a logged-in user id for all tables
  -  **anonymous id column** - The default column that stores an anonymous id for logged-out users
- Users
  -  **table** - Table that contains all logged-in users. Multiple rows per user id are fine since we unique the values before counting.
- Anonymous Id Mapping
  -  **table** - Table that maps logged-out anonymous ids to logged-in user ids
- Page Views
  -  **table** - Table that contains one row per page view.
  -  **url path column** - The column in this table that stores the URL path (e.g. `/about/us`)
- Experiments
  -  **table** - Table that maps a user id to an experiment variation. Duplicate rows are fine since we unique values before counting.
  -  **experiment id column** - The name of the column in this table which stores the experiment id
  -  **variation id column** - The name of the column in this table which stores the variation id
  -  **variation id format** - What format the variation id is stored in.
     1.  Numeric (0 = control, 1 = variation 1, etc.)
     2.  Unique String Keys (e.g. "blue", "random-uuid", etc.)
