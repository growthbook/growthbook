Mixpanel is extremely flexible. To effectively use Growth Book, you'll need to tell us a little bit about how your events are structured.

  -  **Experiment Id Property** - The property name that stores the experiment tracking key

  -  **Variation Id Format** - What format the variation id is stored in.
     1.  Numeric (0 = control, 1 = variation 1, etc.)
