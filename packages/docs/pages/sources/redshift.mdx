# Redshift Data Source

Redshift is a managed data warehouse provided by AWS and is fully compatible with Postgres.

## Connection Info

**Important:** Make sure you whitelist Growth Book's ip address (`52.70.79.40`) so we can connect to your cluster.

We recommend creating a separate readonly database user for Growth Book.  We only run SELECT queries, but it's always better to be on the safe side.
