## Installation

Install the gem

`gem install growthbook`

## Quick Usage

```ruby
require 'growthbook'

# Do this once during app bootup
client = Growthbook::Client.new

# Logged-in id of the user being experimented on
# Can also use an anonymous id like session (see below)
user = client.user(id: "12345")

# 2 variations, 50/50 split
exp = Growthbook::Experiment.new("experiment-id", 2)

result = user.experiment(exp)

case result.variation
when 0
  puts "Control"
when 1
  puts "Variation"
else
  puts "Not in experiment"
end
```

## Client Configuration

The `Growthbook::Client` constructor takes an optional config hash.

Currently, the only option is `enabled` which defaults to true. When false, all experiments are completely disabled.

```ruby
client = Growthbook::Config.new(enabled: false)

# All user.experiment calls will now return -1
```

Config options are public instance variables and you can change them any time:

```ruby
client.enabled=true
```

## User Configuration

The `client.user` method takes a single hash with a few possible keys:

- `id` - The logged-in user id
- `anonId` - An anonymous identifier for the user (session id, cookie, ip, etc.)
- `attributes` - A hash with user attributes. These are never sent across the network and are only used to locally evaluate experiment targeting rules.

Although all of these are technically optional, at least 1 type of id must be set or the user will be excluded from all experiments.

Here is an example that uses all 3 properties:

```ruby
user = client.user(
  # Logged-in user id
  id: "12345",

  # Anonymous id
  anonId: "abcdef",

  # Targeting attributes
  attributes: {
    :premium => true,
    :accountAge => 36,
    :geo => [
      :region => "NY"
    ]
  }
])
```

You can update these at any time:

```ruby
user.id="54321"
user.anonId = "fedcba"
user.attributes={
  :premium => false
}
```

## Experiment Configuration

The default test is a 50/50 split with no targeting or customization. There are a few ways to configure this on a test-by-test basis.

### Option 1: Global Configuration

With this option, you configure all experiments globally once and then reference them via id throughout the code.

```ruby
client.experiments=[
  # Default 50/50 2-way test
  Growthbook::Experiment.new("my-test", 2),

  # 3-way test with reduced coverage and unequal weights
  Growthbook::Experiment.new(
    "my-other-test",
    3,
    :coverage => 0.4,
    :weights => [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]
  )
]

# Later in code, pass the string id instead of the Experiment object
result = user.experiment("my-test")
```

There is a helper method that can import a hash of multiple experiments at once. The expected format follows the GrowthBook API response.

```ruby
require 'json'

# Example response from the GrowthBook API
json = '{
  "status": 200,
  "experiments": {
    "my-test": {
      "variations": 2
    },
    "my-other-test": {
      "variations": 3,
      "weights": [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]
    }
  }
}'
parsed = JSON.parse(json)

client.importExperimentsHash(parsed["experiments"])
```

### Option 2: Inline Experiment Configuration

As shown in the quick start above, you can use a `Growthbook::Experiment` object directly to run an experiment.

The below example shows all of the possible experiment options you can set:

```ruby
# 1st argument is the experiment id
# 2nd argument is the number of variations
experiment = Growthbook::Experiment.new("my-experiment-id", 3,
  # Percent of eligible traffic to include in the test (from 0 to 1)
  :coverage => 0.5,

  # How to split traffic between variations (must add to 1)
  :weights => [0.34, 0.33, 0.33],

  # If false, use the logged-in user id to assign variations
  # If true, use the anonymous id
  :anon => false,

  # If set to an integer, force that variation for all users in the experiment
  :force => 1,

  # Targeting rules
  # Evaluated against user attributes to determine who is included in the test
  :targeting => ["source != google"],

  # Add arbitrary data to the variations (see below for more info)
  :data => {
    "color" => ["blue","green","red"]
  }
)

result = user.experiment(experiment)
```

## Running Experiments

GrowthBook supports 3 different implementation approaches:

1.  Branching
2.  Parameterization
3.  Config System

### Approach 1: Branching

This is the simplest to understand and implement. You add branching via if/else or case statements:

```ruby
result = user.experiment("experiment-id")

if result.variation == 1
    # Variation
    buttonColor = "green"
else
    # Control or Not in experiment
    buttonColor = "blue"
end
```

### Approach 2: Parameterization

With this approach, you parameterize the variations by associating them with data.

```ruby
experiment = Growthbook::Experiment.new("experiment-id", 2,
  :data => {
    "color" => ["blue", "green"]
  }
)

result = user.experiment(experiment)

# Will be either "blue" or "green"
buttonColor = result.data["color"]

# If no data is defined for the key, `nil` is returned
result.data["unknown"] == nil # true
```

### Approach 3: Configuration System

If you already have an existing configuration or feature flag system, you can do a deeper integration that
avoids `experiment` calls throughout your code base entirely.

All you need to do is modify your existing config system to get experiment overrides before falling back to your normal lookup process:

```ruby
# Your existing function
def getConfig(key)
  # Look for a valid matching experiment.
  # If found, choose a variation and return the value for the requested key
  result = user.lookupByDataKey(key)
  if result != nil
    return result.value
  end

  # Continue with your normal lookup process
  ...
end
```

Instead of generic keys like `color`, you probably want to be more descriptive with this approach (e.g. `homepage.cta.color`).

With the following experiment data:

```ruby
{
  :data => {
    "homepage.cta.color" => ["blue", "green"]
  }
}
```

You can now do:

```ruby
buttonColor = getConfig("homepage.cta.color")
```

Your code now no longer cares where the value comes from. It could be a hard-coded config value or part of an experiment. This is the cleanest approach of the 3, but it can be difficult to debug if things go wrong.

## Tracking

When someone is put into an experiment, you'll typically want to log this event in your analytics system.

The user object has an array `resultsToTrack` that stores all experiment results that should be tracked.

For example, if you are using Segment on the front-end, you can add something like this to the bottom of your HTML:

```erb
<% user.resultsToTrack.each do |result| %>
  <script>
  analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
    experiment_id: "<%= result.experiment.id %>",
    variation_id: <%= result.variation_id %>
  })
  </script>
<% end %>
```
