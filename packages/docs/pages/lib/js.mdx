# GrowthBook Javascript Client Library

Supports both browser and NodeJS environments.

## Installation

`yarn add @growthbook/growthbook`

or

`npm install --save @growthbook/growthbook`

or use directly in your HTML without installing first:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { GrowthBook } from "https://unpkg.com/@growthbook/growthbook/dist/bundles/esm.min.js";
  //...
</script>
```

## Quick Usage

```ts
import { GrowthBook } from "@growthbook/growthbook";

// Define the experimental context
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  // The attributes used to assign variations
  user: { id: "123" },
  // Called when a user is put into an experiment
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
      experimentId: experiment.key,
      variationId: result.variationId,
    });
  },
});

// Run an experiment
const { value } = growthbook.run({
  key: "my-experiment",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

console.log(value); // "A" or "B"
```

## GrowthBook class

The GrowthBook constructor takes a `Context` object. Below are all of the possible Context properties:

- **enabled** (`boolean`) - Switch to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
- **user** (`{}`) - Map of user attributes that are used to assign variations
- **groups** (`{}`) - A map of which groups the user belongs to (key is the group name, value is boolean)
- **url** (`string`) - The URL of the current page (defaults to `window.location.href` when in a browser environment)
- **overrides** (`{}`) - Override properties of specific experiments (used for Remote Config)
- **forcedVariations** (`{}`) - Force specific experiments to always assign a specific variation (used for QA)
- **qaMode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
- **trackingCallback** (`function`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.

## Experiments

Below are all of the possible properties you can set for an Experiment:

- **key** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **status** (`string`) - "running" is the default and always active. "draft" is only active during QA and development. "stopped" is only active when forcing a winning variation to 100% of users.
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **url** (`RegExp`) - Users can only be included in this experiment if the current URL matches this regex
- **include** (`() => boolean`) - A callback that returns true if the user should be part of the experiment and false if they should not be
- **groups** (`string[]`) - Limits the experiment to specific user groups
- **force** (`number`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specific variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to "id")

## Running Experiments

Run experiments by calling `growthbook.run(experiment)` which returns an object with a few useful properties:

```ts
const {
  inExperiment,
  variationId,
  value,
  hashAttribute,
  hashValue,
} = growthbook.run({
  key: "my-experiment",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

// If user is part of the experiment
console.log(inExperiment); // true or false

// The index of the assigned variation
console.log(variationId); // 0 or 1

// The value of the assigned variation
console.log(value); // "A" or "B"

// The user attribute used to assign a variation
console.log(hashAttribute); // "id"

// The value of that attribute
console.log(hashValue); // e.g. "123"
```

The `inExperiment` flag is only set to true if the user was randomly assigned a variation. If the user failed any targeting rules or was forced into a specific variation, this flag will be false.

### Example Experiments

3-way experiment with uneven variation weights:

```ts
growthbook.run({
  key: "3-way-uneven",
  variations: ["A", "B", "C"],
  weights: [0.5, 0.25, 0.25],
});
```

Slow rollout (10% of users who opted into "beta" features):

```ts
// User is in the "qa" and "beta" groups
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  user: { id: "123" },
  groups: {
    qa: isQATester(),
    beta: betaFeaturesEnabled(),
  },
});

growthbook.run({
  key: "slow-rollout",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
  coverage: 0.1,
  groups: ["beta"],
});
```

Complex variations and custom targeting

```ts
const {value} = growthbook.run({
  key: "complex-variations",
  variations: [
    {color: "blue", size: "large"},
    {color: "green", size: "small"}
  ],
  url: /^\/post\/[0-9]+$/i
  include: () => isPremium || creditsRemaining > 50
});

console.log(value.color, value.size); // blue,large OR green,small
```

Assign variations based on something other than user id

```ts
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  user: {
    id: "123",
    company: "growthbook",
  },
});

growthbook.run({
  key: "by-company-id",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
  hashAttribute: "company",
});

// Users in the same company will always get the same variation
```

### Overriding Experiment Configuration

It's common practice to adjust experiment settings after a test is live. For example, slowly ramping up traffic, stopping a test automatically if guardrail metrics go down, or rolling out a winning variation to 100% of users.

For example, to roll out a winning variation to 100% of users:

```ts
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  user: { id: "123" },
  overrides: {
    "experiment-key": {
      status: "stopped",
      force: 1,
    },
  },
});

const { value } = growthbook.run({
  key: "experiment-key",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

console.log(value); // Always "B"
```

The full list of experiment properties you can override is:

- status
- force
- weights
- coverage
- groups
- url (can use string instead of regex if serializing in a database)

If you use the GrowthBook App (https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) to manage experiments, there's a built-in API endpoint you can hit that returns overrides in this exact format. It's a great way to make sure your experiments are always up-to-date.

## Typescript

This module exposes Typescript types if needed.

This is especially useful if experiments are defined as a variable before being passed into `growthbook.run`. Unions and tuples are used heavily and Typescript has trouble inferring those properly.

```ts
import type {
  Context,
  Experiment,
  Result,
  ExperimentOverride,
} from "@growthbook/growthbook";

// The "number" part refers to the variation type
const exp: Experiment<number> = {
  key: "my-test",
  variations: [0, 1],
  status: "stoped", // Type error! (should be "stopped")
};
```

## Event Tracking and Analyzing Results

This library only handles assigning variations to users. The 2 other parts required for an A/B testing platform are Tracking and Analysis.

### Tracking

It's likely you already have some event tracking on your site with the metrics you want to optimize (Google Analytics, Segment, Mixpanel, etc.).

For A/B tests, you just need to track one additional event - when someone views a variation.

```ts
// Specify a tracking callback when instantiating the client
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  user: { id: "123" },
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    // ...
  },
});
```

Below are examples for a few popular event tracking tools:

#### Google Analytics

```ts
ga("send", "event", "experiment", experiment.key, result.variationId, {
  // Custom dimension for easier analysis
  dimension1: `${experiment.key}::${result.variationId}`,
});
```

#### Segment

```ts
analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
  experimentId: experiment.key,
  variationId: result.variationId,
});
```

#### Mixpanel

```ts
mixpanel.track("$experiment_started", {
  "Experiment name": experiment.key,
  "Variant name": result.variationId,
});
```

### Analysis

Now just connect GrowthBook to the data source where your tracked events end up (Mixpanel, GA, or a data warehouse like Snowflake)
and you can pull the data, run it through the built-in stats engine, and analyze results.

## Dev Mode

If you are using this library to run experiments client-side in a browser, you can use the GrowthBook Dev Mode widget to make development and testing easier.

Simply add the following script tag to your development or staging site:

```html
<script
  async
  src="https://unpkg.com/@growthbook/dev/dist/bundles/index.min.js"
></script>
```

and you should see the Dev Mode widget on the bottom-left of your screen
