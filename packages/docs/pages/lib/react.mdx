## Installation

`yarn add @growthbook/growthbook-react` 

or 

`npm install --save @growthbook/growthbook-react`

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure your app 
```tsx
import {
  GrowthBookClient, GrowthBookProvider
} from '@growthbook/growthbook-react'

// Create a client instance and setup tracking
const client = new GrowthBookClient({
  onExperimentViewed: ({experimentId, variationId}) => {
    // Mixpanel, Segment, GA, or custom tracking
    mixpanel.track("Experiment Viewed", {experimentId, variationId})
  }
});

// Specify the user id you want to experiment on
const user = client.user({ id: mixpanel.get_distinct_id() })

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GrowthBookProvider user={user}>
      <OtherComponent/>
    </GrowthBookProvider>
  )
}
```

### Step 2: Run an experiment

```tsx
import { useExperiment } from '@growthbook/growthbook-react'

export default function OtherComponent() {
  const { value } = useExperiment({
    key: "new-headline",
    variations: ["Hello", "Hi", "Good Day"],
  })

  return <h1>{ value }</h1>
}
```

Use class components? We support that too!  See below.

## Dev Mode

If `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` AND you are in a browser environment, dev mode is enabled by default. You can override this behavior by explicitly passing in the `disableDevMode` prop to `GrowthBookProvider`.

Dev Mode adds a variation switcher UI that floats on the bottom left of pages.  Use this to easily test out all the experiment combinations. It also includes a screenshot tool to download images of all your variations.

## Experiments

The simplest experiment you can define has just 2 fields: `key` and `variations`.

There are a lot more configuration options you can specify.  Here is the full typescript definition:

```ts
interface Experiment {
    // The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
    key: string;
    // Array of variations
    variations: any[];
    // How to weight traffic between variations. Array of floats that add to 1.
    weights?: number[];
    // "running" is always active
    // "draft" is only active during QA
    // "stopped" is only active when forcing a winning variation
    status?: "draft" | "running" | "stopped";
    // What percent of users should be included in the experiment. Float from 0 to 1.
    coverage?: number;
    // Users can only be included in this experiment if the current URL matches this regex
    url?: string;
    // Array of strings if the format "{key} {operator} {value}"
    // Users must pass all of these targeting rules to be included in this experiment
    targeting?: string[];
    // All users included in the experiment will be forced into the 
    // specified variation index
    force?: number;
    // If true, use anonymous id for assigning, otherwise use logged-in user id
    anon?: boolean;
}
```

## Running Experiments

The useExperiment hook returns an object with a few useful properties

```ts
const {inExperiment, variationId, value} = useExperiment({
    key: "my-experiment",
    variations: ["A", "B"]
});

// If user is part of the experiment
console.log(inExperiment); // true or false

// The index of the assigned variation
console.log(variationId); // 0 or 1

// The value of the assigned variation
console.log(value); // "A" or "B"
```

The `inExperiment` flag can be false if the experiment defines any sort of targeting rules which the user does not pass.  In this case, the user is always assigned index `0`.

## Client Configuration

The GrowthBookClient constructor takes an optional `options` argument.

Below are all of the available options:

-  **enabled** - Default true. Set to false to completely disable all experiments.
-  **debug** - Default false. If set to true, console.log info about why experiments are run and why specific variations are chosen.
-  **onExperimentViewed** - Callback when the user views an experiment. Passed an object with `experiment` and `variation` properties.
-  **url** - The URL for the current request (defaults to `window.location.href` when in a browser)
-  **enableQueryStringOverride** - Default true.  If true, enables forcing variations via the URL.  Very useful for QA.  https://example.com/?my-experiment=1

### SPA support

With a Single Page App (SPA), you need to update the client on navigation in order to target tests based on URL:

```ts
client.setUrl(newUrl);
```

Doing this with Next.js for example, will look like this:
```tsx
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    const onChange = (newUrl) => client.setUrl(newUrl);
    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', onChange);
    return () => router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', onChange);
  }, [])

  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

## User Configuration

The `client.user` method supports both logged-in and anonymous users. To create an anonymous user, specify `anonId` instead of `id`:
```js
const user = client.user({anonId: "abcdef"});
```

If you have both an anonymous id and a logged-in user id, you can pass both:
```js
const user = client.user({
    anonId: "abcdef",
    userId: "12345"
});
```

You can also include attributes about the user.  These attributes are never sent across the network and are only used to locally evaluate experiment targeting rules:

```js
const user = client.user({
    id: "12345",
    attributes: {
        // Any attributes about the user or page that you want to use for experiment targeting
        premium: true,
        accountAge: 36,
        source: "google"
    }
});
```

You can update these at any time by calling `user.setAttributes`. By default, this completely overwrites all previous attributes. To do a 
shallow merge instead, pass `true` as the 2nd argument.

```js
user.setAttributes({
    premium: false
})
```

### Targeting

Experiments can target on these user attributes with the `targeting` field.  Here's an example:

```ts
const {inExperiment, value} = useExperiment({
    key: "my-targeted-experiment",
    variations: ["A", "B"],
    targeting: [
        "premium = true",
        "accountAge > 30"
    ]
})
```

If the user does not match the targeting rules, `inExperiment` will be false and they will be assigned variation index `0`.

## Overriding Weights and Targeting

It's common practice to adjust experiment settings after a test is live.  For example, slowly ramping up traffic, stopping a test automatically if guardrail metrics go down, or rolling out a winning variation to 100% of users.

Instead of constantly changing your code, you can use client overrides.  For example, to roll out a winning variation to 100% of users:
```ts
client.overrides.set("experiment-key", {
    status: 'stopped',
    // Force variation index 1
    force: 1
});
```

The full list of experiment properties you can override is:
*  status
*  force
*  weights
*  coverage
*  targeting
*  url

This data structure can be easily seralized and stored in a database or returned from an API.  There is a small helper function if you have all of your overrides in a single JSON object:

```ts
client.importOverrides({
    "key1": {...},
    "key2": {...},
    ...
})
```

## Event Tracking

This library only handles assigning variations to users.  The 2 other parts required for an A/B testing platform are Tracking and Analysis.

It's likely you already have some event tracking on your site with the metrics you want to optimize (Google Analytics, Segment, Mixpanel, etc.).

For A/B tests, you just need to track one additional event - when someone views a variation.  

```ts
// Specify a tracking callback when instantiating the client
const client = new GrowthBookClient({
    onExperimentViewed: ({experimentId, variationId}) => {
      // ...
    }
});
```

The object passed to your callback has the following properties:
-  experimentId (the key of the experiment)
-  variationId (the array index of the assigned variation)
-  value (the value of the assigned variation)
-  experiment (the full experiment object)
-  userId
-  anonId
-  userAttributes

Below are examples for a few popular event tracking tools:

### Google Analytics
```ts
ga('send', 'event', 'experiment', experimentId, variationId, {
  // Custom dimension for easier analysis
  'dimension1': `${experimentId}::${variationId}`
});
```

### Segment
```ts
analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
  experimentId,
  variationId
});
```

### Mixpanel
```ts
mixpanel.track("$experiment_started", {
  'Experiment name': experimentId,
  'Variant name': variationId
});
```

## React Class Components

If you aren't using functional components, we offer a `withRunExperiment` Higher Order Component instead.

**Note:** This library uses hooks internally, so still requires React 16.8 or above.

```tsx
import {withRunExperiment} from '@growthbook/growthbook-react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    // The `runExperiment` prop is identical to the `useExperiment` hook
    const {value} = this.props.runExperiment({
      key: "headline-test",
      variations: ["Hello World", "Hola Mundo"]
    });

    return <h1>{value}</h1>
  }
}

// Wrap your component in `withRunExperiment`
export default withRunExperiment(MyComponent);
```
