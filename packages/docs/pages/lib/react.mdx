# ReactJS

This is a thin wrapper on top of the [Javascript Library](/lib/js), so you might want to view those docs first to familiarize yourself with the basic classes and methods.

## Installation

```
yarn add @growthbook/growthbook-react
```

or

```
npm install --save @growthbook/growthbook-react
```

## Quick Usage

### Step 1: Configure your app

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { GrowthBook, GrowthBookProvider } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

// Create a GrowthBook instance
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  // Callback when a user is put into an A/B experiment
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    console.log("Experiment Viewed", {
      experimentId: experiment.key,
      variationId: result.variationId,
    });
  },
});

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load feature definitions from GrowthBook API
    fetch("https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/<your api key>")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((parsed) => {
        growthbook.setFeatures(parsed.features);
      });

    // Set user attributes for targeting (from cookie, auth system, etc.)
    growthbook.setAttributes({
      id: "123",
      company: "acme",
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <GrowthBookProvider growthbook={growthbook}>
      <OtherComponent />
    </GrowthBookProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Start feature flagging!

There are a few ways to use feature flags in GrowthBook:

#### useFeature hook

```tsx
import { useFeature } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  // Boolean on/off flags
  const newLogin = useFeature("new-login-form").on;

  // Multivariate or string/JSON values
  const buttonColor = useFeature("login-button-color").value || "blue";

  if (newLogin) {
    return <NewLogin color={buttonColor} />;
  } else {
    return <Login color={buttonColor} />;
  }
}
```

#### IfFeatureEnabled component

```tsx
import { IfFeatureEnabled } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <IfFeatureEnabled feature="welcome-message">
        <p>Welcome to our site!</p>
      </IfFeatureEnabled>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### FeatureString component

```tsx
import { FeatureString } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>
        <FeatureString feature="site-h1" default="My Site" />
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### useGrowthBook hook

If you need low-level access to the GrowthBook instance for any reason, you can use the `useGrowthBook` hook:

```tsx
import { useGrowthBook } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  // Identical to: const feature = useFeature("my-feature")
  const growthbook = useGrowthBook();
  const feature = growthbook.feature("my-feature");
}
```

## The GrowthBook Context

The `GrowthBook` constructor takes a number of optional settings.

### Features

If you already have features loaded as a JSON object, you can pass them into the constructor with the `features` field:

```ts
new GrowthBook({
  features: {
    "feature-1": {...},
    "feature-2": {...},
    "another-feature": {...},
  }
})
```

If you need to load feature definitions from a remote source like an API or database, you can update the context at any time with `setFeatures()` (seen above in the Quick Start). **Note** - if you try to use a feature before it is loaded, it will always evaluate to `null`.

If you use the GrowthBook App to manage your features, you don't need to build this JSON file yourself - it will auto-generate one for you and make it available via an API endpoint.

If you prefer to build this file by hand or you want to know how it works under the hood, check out the detailed [Feature Definitions](/lib/js#feature-definitions) section in the Javascript SDK docs.

### Attributes

You can specify attributes about the current user and request. These are used for two things:

1.  Feature targeting (e.g. paid users get one value, free users get another)
2.  Assigning persistent variations in A/B tests (e.g. user id "123" always gets variation B)

The following are some comonly used attributes, but use whatever makes sense for your application.

```ts
new GrowthBook({
  attributes: {
    id: "123",
    loggedIn: true,
    deviceId: "abc123def456",
    company: "acme",
    paid: false,
    url: "/pricing",
    browser: "chrome",
    mobile: false,
    country: "US",
  },
});
```

If you need to set or update attributes asynchronously, you can do so with `setAttributes()`. This will completely overwrite the attributes object with whatever you pass in. Also, be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully.

### Tracking Callback

Any time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, we call a function so you can record the assigned value in your event tracking or analytics system of choice.

```ts
new GrowthBook({
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    // Example using Segment.io
    analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
      experimentId: experiment.key,
      variationId: result.variationId,
    });
  },
});
```

### Feature Usage Callback

GrowthBook can fire a callback whenever a feature is evaluated for a user. This can be useful to update 3rd party tools like NewRelic or DataDog.

```ts
new GrowthBook({
  onFeatureUsage: (featureKey, result) => {
    console.log("feature", featureKey, "has value", result.value);
  },
});
```

The `result` argument is the same thing returned from the `useFeature` hook.

Note: If you evaluate the same feature multiple times (and the value doesn't change), the callback will only be fired the first time.

### Encrypting SDK Endpoints

When creating an SDK endpoint, you have the option to enable encryption. When enabled, GrowthBook will encrypt the list of features returned in the API response.

With encryption enabled, the response would be:

```js
  {
    status: 200,
    features: {},
    encryptedFeatures: {
      content: "encryptedFeatures",
      iv: "hash"
    }
  }
```

Encryption is handled via WebCrypto API's `SubtleCrypto` and uses the RSA-OAEP algorithm and hashed with `SHA-256`. An example of how to decrypt the features is below:

```ts
// This can be found in your account under /settings/keys
const privateKeyString = "sample_key";

function stringToBuffer(str: string) {
  const buf = new ArrayBuffer(str.length);
  const bufView = new Uint8Array(buf);
  for (let i = 0, strLen = str.length; i < strLen; i++) {
    bufView[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return buf;
}

async function privateKeyStringToBuffer(keyString: string) {
  const binaryString = atob(keyString);
  const buffer = stringToBuffer(binaryString);
  const key = await window.crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "pkcs8",
    buffer,
    {
      name: "RSA-OAEP",
      hash: "SHA-256",
    },
    true,
    ["decrypt"]
  );

  return key;
}

useEffect(() => {
  // Load feature definitions JSON from GrowthBook API
  fetch("https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/<your api key>")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(async (json) => {
        const privateKey = await privateKeyStringToBuffer(privateKeyString);
        const encryptedFeaturesBuf = await stringToBuffer(
          json.encrpytedFeatures
        );
        const featuresBuf = await window.crypto.subtle.decrypt(
          { name: "RSA-OAEP" },
          privateKey,
          encryptedFeaturesBuf
        );
        const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf8");
        const features = decoder.decode(featuresBuf);
        growthbook.setFeatures(JSON.parse(features));
      }
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      console.log(e.message);
      console.log("Failed to fetch GrowthBook feature definitions");
    });
}, [router.pathname]);
```

## Inline Experiments

Depending on how you configure feature flags, they may run A/B tests behind the scenes to determine which value gets assigned to the user.

Sometimes though, you want to run an inline experiment without going through a feature flag first. For this, you can use either the `useExperiment` hook or the Higher Order Component `withRunExperiment`:

### useExperiment hook

```tsx
import { useExperiment } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  const { value } = useExperiment({
    key: "new-headline",
    variations: ["Hello", "Hi", "Good Day"],
  });

  return <h1>{value}</h1>;
}
```

### Class Components

**Note:** This library uses hooks internally, so still requires React 16.8 or above.

```tsx
import { withRunExperiment } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

class OtherComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // The `runExperiment` prop is identical to the `useExperiment` hook
    const { value } = this.props.runExperiment({
      key: "headline-test",
      variations: ["Hello World", "Hola Mundo"],
    });
    return <h1>{value}</h1>;
  }
}
// Wrap your component in `withRunExperiment`
export default withRunExperiment(OtherComponent);
```
