## Installation

`yarn add @growthbook/growthbook-react`

or

`npm install --save @growthbook/growthbook-react`

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Configure your app

```tsx
import { GrowthBook, GrowthBookProvider } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

// Create a GrowthBook instance
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  // The attributes you want to use to assign variations
  user: {
    id: "123",
  },
  // Called every time the user is put into an experiment
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    // Mixpanel, Segment, GA, or custom tracking
    mixpanel.track("Experiment Viewed", {
      experiment: experiment.key,
      variation: result.variationId,
    });
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GrowthBookProvider growthbook={growthbook}>
      <OtherComponent />
    </GrowthBookProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Run an experiment

#### Hooks (recommended)

```tsx
import { useExperiment } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

export default function OtherComponent() {
  const { value } = useExperiment({
    key: "new-headline",
    variations: ["Hello", "Hi", "Good Day"],
  });

  return <h1>{value}</h1>;
}
```

#### Class Components

**Note:** This library uses hooks internally, so still requires React 16.8 or above.

```tsx
import { withRunExperiment } from "@growthbook/growthbook-react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    // The `runExperiment` prop is identical to the `useExperiment` hook
    const { value } = this.props.runExperiment({
      key: "headline-test",
      variations: ["Hello World", "Hola Mundo"],
    });
    return <h1>{value}</h1>;
  }
}
// Wrap your component in `withRunExperiment`
export default withRunExperiment(MyComponent);
```

### Step 3: Analyze results

Query your raw data, calculate significance, decide on a winner, and document your findings.

The easiest way to accomplish this is with the Growth Book App (https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook), but it's not required. You can use an online A/B test calculator or a Jupyter notebook if you prefer.

## Dev Mode

If `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` AND you are in a browser environment, dev mode is enabled by default. You can override this behavior by explicitly passing in the `disableDevMode` prop to `GrowthBookProvider`.

Dev Mode adds a variation switcher UI that floats on the bottom left of pages. Use this to easily test out all the experiment combinations. It also includes a screenshot tool to download images of all your variations.

## Configuration and Usage

This package is a small React wrapper around the [javascript client library](/lib/js). Look at those docs for more info on how to configure your GrowthBook instance and define Experiments.
