# Client Libraries

We offer official client libraries in a few popular languages with more coming soon:

*  [Javascript/Typescript](/lib/js)
*  [React](/lib/react)
*  [PHP](/lib/php)
*  [Ruby](/lib/ruby)
*  Go - *coming soon*
*  Python - *coming soon*

It's not required to use these libraries.  You can do variation assignment yourself or use another library like PlanOut.

The only requirement is that you track in your datasource when users are put into an experiment and which variation they received.
