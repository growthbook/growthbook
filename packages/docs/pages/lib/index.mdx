# SDKs

We offer official SDKs in a few popular languages:

- [Javascript/Typescript](/lib/js)
- [React](/lib/react)
- [PHP](/lib/php)
- [Ruby](/lib/ruby)
- [Python](/lib/python)
- [Go](/lib/go)
- [Kotlin (Android)](/lib/kotlin)
- [Swift](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-swift)
- [Flutter](/lib/flutter)

We also have community created SDKs:

- [C#](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-c-sharp)

There is also a guide if you want to [build your own](/lib/build-your-own).

It's not required to use any of these libraries. The only requirement is that you track in your datasource when users are put into an experiment and which variation they received.
