# Build Your Own Client Library

This guide is meant for library authors looking to build a GrowthBook client library in a currently unsupported language.

GrowthBook client libraries are very simple and do not interact with the filesystem or network. Because of this, they can often be kept to **under 1000 lines of code**.

All libraries should follow this specification as closely as the language permits to maintain consistency.

## Data structures

There are a number of important data structures in GrowthBook client libraries.

### Condition

Targeting condition based on MongoDB query syntax. For example:

```ts
{
  "country": "US",
  "browser": {
    "$in": ["firefox", "chrome"]
  },
  "email": {
    "$not": {
      "$regex": "@gmail.com$"
    }
  }
}
```

### Context

Defines the GrowthBook context. At a minimum, the context should support the following optional properties:

- **enabled** (`boolean`) - Switch to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
- **attributes** (`Map`) - Map of user attributes that are used to assign variations
- **url** (`string`) - The URL of the current page
- **features** (`Map`) - Feature definitions (usually pulled from an API or cache)
- **overrides** (`Map`) - Experiment overrides (usually pulled from an API or cache)
- **forcedVariations** (`Map`) - Force specific experiments to always assign a specific variation (used for QA)
- **qaMode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
- **trackingCallback** (`function`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.

Attributes are an arbitrary JSON object containing user and request attributes. Here's an example:

```jsons
{
  "id": "123",
  "anonId": "abcdef",
  "company": "growthbook",
  "url": "/pricing",
  "country": "US",
  "browser": "firefox",
  "age": 25,
  "beta": true,
  "account": {
    "plan": "team",
    "seats": 10
  }
}
```

An example of `trackingCallback` in javascript:

```js
function track(experiment, result) {
  analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
    experimentId: experiment.key,
    variationId: result.variationId,
  });
}
```

### Experiment

Defines a single experiment:

- **trackingKey** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **active** (`boolean`) - If set to false, always return the control (first variation)
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **condition** (`Condition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **include** (`() => boolean`) - A callback that returns true if the user should be part of the experiment and false if they should not be
- **namespace** (`(string, number, number)`) - A tuple that contains the namespace identifier, plus a range of coverage for the experiment.
- **force** (`number`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specific variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

The only required properties are `key` and `variations`. Everything else is optional.

### ExperimentResult

The result of running an Experiment given a specific Context

- **inExperiment** (`boolean`) - Whether or not the user is part of the experiment
- **variationId** (`string`) - The array index of the assigned variation
- **value** (`any`) - The array value of the assigned variation
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - The user attribute used to assign a variation
- **hashValue** (`string)` - The value of that attribute

The `variationId` and `value` should always be set, even when `inExperiment` is false.

### ExperimentOverride

`context.overrides` is a JSON object. Keys are experiment trackingKeys and the value is an ExperimentOverride object:

```js
context = {
  "overrides": {
    "key1": {...},
    "key2": {...}
  }
}
```

An ExperimentOverride object is similar to an Experiment object, but only contains a subset of the possible properties:

- weights
- active
- coverage
- condition
- force

### Feature

`context.features` is a JSON object. Keys are unique identifiers for the features and the values are Feature objects.

```js
{
  "feature-1": {...},
  "feature-2": {...},
  "feature-3": {...}
}
```

A Feature object consists of possible values plus rules for how to assign values to users.

- **values** (`any[]`) - Array of all possible values for the feature
- **defaultValue** (`number`) - The array index of values that should be the default (should use `0` if unspecified)
- **rules** (`Rule[]`) - Array of Rule objects that determine when and how the defaultValue gets overridden

### FeatureRule

There are 2 types of rules

Force rules:

- **type** (`string`) - Always set to `"force"`
- **condition** (`Condition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **value** (`number`) - The array index of values that should be assigned

Experiment rules:

- **type** (`string`) - Always set to `"experiment"`
- **condition** (`Condition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **trackingKey** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`number[]`) - The different array indexes on values that are part of the experiment (default to all of them)
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **namespace** (`(string, number, number)`) - A tuple that contains the namespace identifier, plus a range of coverage for the experiment.
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

### FeatureResult

- **value** (`any`) - The assigned value of the feature
- **on** (`boolean`) - The assigned value cast to a boolean
- **off** (`boolean`) - The assigned value cast to a boolean and then negated
- **source** (`enum`) - One of "unknownFeature", "defaultValue", "force", or "experiment"
- **experiment** (`Experiment`) - When source is "experiment", this will be the Experiment object used

## Using the Library

The main export of the libraries is a simple `GrowthBook` wrapper class that takes a `Context` object in the constructor.

It exposes two main methods: `feature` and `run`.

## Evaluating a Feature

The `feature` method takes a single string argument, which is the unique identifier for the feature and returns a `FeatureResult` object.

```js
growthbook = new GrowthBook(context);
myFeature = growthbook.feature("my-feature");
```

There are a few ordered steps to evaluate a feature

1. If the key doesn't exist in `context.features`, return immediately (value = `null`, source = `unknownFeature`).
2. If `values` are not specified for the feature, default to `[false, true]`.
3. Loop through the feature rules (if any)
   1. If the rule has a `condition` and it evaluates to false, skip this rule and continue to the next one
   2. If the rule type is force, return immediately (value = forced value, source = `force`)
   3. If the rule type is experiment, convert the rule to an Experiment object and run the experiment.
      ```ts
      const exp = {
        variations: rule.variations
          ? rule.variations.map((i) => values[i])
          : values,
        trackingKey: rule.trackingKey || featureKey,
      };
      if (rule.coverage) exp.coverage = rule.coverage;
      if (rule.weights) exp.weights = rule.weights;
      if (rule.hashAttribute) exp.hashAttribute = rule.hashAttribute;
      if (rule.namespace) exp.namespace = rule.namespace;
      ```
   4. Run the experiment. If `result.inExperiment` is false, skip this rule and continue to the next one. Otherwise, return immediately (value = assigned variation, source = `experiment`)
4. Return (value = defaultValue, source = `defaultValue`)

## Running an Experiment

The `run` method takes an Experiment object and returns an `ExperimentResult`:

```js
growthbook = new GrowthBook(context);
result = growthbook.run(experiment);
```

There are a bunch of ordered steps to run an experiment:

1.  If `experiment.variations` has fewer than 2 variations, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
2.  If `context.enabled` is false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
3.  If `context.overrides[experiment.trackingKey]` is set, merge override properties into the experiment
4.  If `context.url` contains a querystring `{experiment.trackingKey}=[0-9]+`, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId from querystring)
5.  If `context.forcedVariations[experiment.trackingKey]` is defined, return immediately (not in experiment, forced variation)
6.  If `experiment.action` is set to false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
7.  Get the user hash attribute and value (`context.attributes[experiment.hashAttribute || "id"]`) and if empty, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
8.  If `experiment.namespace` is set, check if hash value is included in the range and if not, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
9.  If `experiment.include` is set, call the function and if "false" is returned or it throws, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
10. If `experiment.condition` is set and the condition evaluates to false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
11. If `experiment.force` is set, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `experiment.force`)
12. If `context.qaMode` is true, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
13. Default variation weights and coverage if not specified

    ```js
    // Default weights to an even split between all variations
    weights = experiment.weights;
    if (!weights) {
      weights = Array(experiment.variations.length).fill(
        1 / experiment.variations.length
      );
    }

    // Default coverage to 1 (100%)
    coverage = experiment.coverage ?? 1;
    ```

14. Calculate bucket ranges for the variations

    ```js
    // Convert weights/coverage to ranges
    // 50/50 split at 100% coverage == [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 1]]
    // 20/80 split with 50% coverage == [[0, 0.1], [0.2, 0.6]]
    cumulative = 0;
    ranges = weights.map((w) => {
      start = cumulative;
      cumulative += w;
      return [start, start + coverage * w];
    });
    ```

15. Compute a hash using the [Fowler–Noll–Vo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) algorithm (specifically fnv32-1a) and assign a variation

    ```js
    n = (fnv32_1a(id + experiment.key) % 1000) / 1000;

    assigned = -1;
    ranges.forEach((range, i) => {
      if (n >= range[0] && n < range[1]) {
        assigned = i;
      }
    });
    ```

16. If not assigned a variation (`assigned === -1`), return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
17. Fire `context.trackingCallback` if set and the combination of hashAttribute, hashValue, experiment.key, and variationId has not been tracked before
18. Return (**in experiment**, assigned variation)

## Developer Experience

Having a good developer experience is super important.

### Basic Usage

It should be extremely easy and natural to use features, both on/off flags and full remote config features.

```js
// On/off flag
if (growthbook.feature("my-feature").on) {
  // ...
}

// Remote config
color = growthbook.feature("signup-button-color").value || "blue";
```

The developer doesn't need to care how the value of a feature was determined, whether it came from a default, an experiment, or through complex targeting rules.

In most cases, this is all the developer will ever need to do. If they do need to run an inline experiment, it should be very simple to run a basic A/B test:

```js
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "my-experiment",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

print(result.value); // "A" or "B"
```

And it should feel natural to scale up to more complex use cases:

```js
// 50% of beta testers, 80/20 split between variations
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "complex-experiment",
  variations: [
    { color: "blue", size: "small" },
    { color: "green", size: "large" },
  ],
  weights: [0.8, 0.2],
  coverage: 0.5,
  condition: {
    beta: true,
  },
});

print(result.value.color, result.value.size);
// "blue,small" OR "green,large"
```

### Type Hinting

Most languages have some sort of strong typing support, whether in the language itself or via annotations. This helps to reduce errors and is highly encouraged for client libraries.

If possible, use generics to type the return value. If `experiment.variations` is type `T[]`, then `result.value` should be type `T`.

If your type system supports specifying a minimum array length, it's best to type `experiment.variations` as requiring at least 2 elements.

### Handling Errors

The general rule is to be strict in development and lenient in production.

You can throw exceptions in development, but someone's production app should never crash because of a call to `growthbook.feature` or `growthbook.run`.

For the below edge cases in production, just act as if the problematic property didn't exist and ignore errors:

- `experiment.weights` is a different length from `experiment.variations`
- `experiment.weights` adds up to something other than 1
- `experiment.coverage` is greater than 1
- `context.trackingCallback` throws an error
- URL querystring specifies an invalid variation index

For the below edge cases in production, the experiment should be disabled (everyone gets assigned variation `0`):

- `experiment.url` is an invalid regex
- `experiment.coverage` is less than 0
- `experiment.force` specifies an invalid variation index
- `context.forcedVariations` specifies an invalid variation index
- `experiment.include` throws an error
- `experiment.hashAttribute` is an empty string

### Subscriptions

Sometimes it's useful to be able to "subscribe" to a GrowthBook instance and be alerted every time `growthbook.run` is called. This is different from the tracking callback since it also fires when a user is _not_ included in an experiment.

```js
growthbook.subscribe(function (experiment, result) {
  // do something
});
```

It's best to only re-fire the callbacks for an experiment if the result has changed. That means either the `inExperiment` flag has changed or the `variationId` has changed.

If it makes sense for your language, this function should return an "unsubscriber". A simple callback that removes the subscription.

```js
unsubscriber = growthbook.subscribe(...)
unsubscriber()
```

In addition to subscriptions you may also want to expose a `growthbook.getAllResults` method that returns a map of the latest results indexed by experiment key.

### Memory Management

Subscriptions and tracking calls require storing references to many objects and functions. If it makes sense for your language, libraries should provide a `growthbook.destroy` method to remove all of these references and release their memory.

## Tests

We strive to have 100% test coverage for all of our client libraries. Since they all use the same data structures, the test suites are pretty transferrable between languages. Pick the closest existing SDK as a guide and adapt as needed.
