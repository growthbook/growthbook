# Build Your Own Client Library

This guide is meant for library authors looking to build a GrowthBook client library in a currently unsupported language.

GrowthBook client libraries are very simple and do not interact with the filesystem or network. Because of this, they can often be kept to **under 500 lines of code**.

All libraries should follow this specification as closely as the language permits to maintain consistency.

## Data structures

These are the 3 main data structures used in the client libraries.

`Context + Experiment = Result`

### Context

Defines the experimental context (attributes used for variation assignment and targeting).

At a minimum, the context should support the following optional properties:

- **enabled** (`boolean`) - Switch to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
- **user** (`Map`) - Map of user attributes that are used to assign variations
- **groups** (`Map`) - A map of which groups the user belongs to (key is the group name, value is boolean)
- **url** (`string`) - The URL of the current page
- **overrides** (`Map`) - Override properties of specific experiments (used for Remote Config)
- **forcedVariations** (`Map`) - Force specific experiments to always assign a specific variation (used for QA)
- **qaMode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
- **trackingCallback** (`function`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.

An example of a `user`:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "anonId": "abcdef",
  "company": "growthbook"
}
```

An example of `trackingCallback` in javascript:

```js
function track(experiment, result) {
  analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
    experimentId: experiment.key,
    variationId: result.variationId,
  });
}
```

### Experiment

Defines a single experiment:

- **key** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **status** (`string`) - "running" is the default and always active. "draft" is only active during QA and development. "stopped" is only active when forcing a winning variation to 100% of users.
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **url** (`RegExp`) - Users can only be included in this experiment if the current URL matches this regex
- **include** (`() => boolean`) - A callback that returns true if the user should be part of the experiment and false if they should not be
- **groups** (`string[]`) - Limits the experiment to specific user groups
- **force** (`number`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specific variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

The only required properties are `key` and `variations`. Everything else is optional.

### Result

The result of running an Experiment given a specific Context

- **inExperiment** (`boolean`) - Whether or not the user is part of the experiment
- **variationId** (`string`) - The array index of the assigned variation
- **value** (`any`) - The array value of the assigned variation
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - The user attribute used to assign a variation
- **hashValue** (`string)` - The value of that attribute

The `variationId` and `value` should always be set, even when `inExperiment` is false.

## Running an Experiment

The main export of the libraries is a simple `GrowthBook` wrapper class with a `run` method that returns a `Result` object.

```js
growthbook = new GrowthBook(context);
result = growthbook.run(experiment);
```

There are a bunch of ordered steps to run an experiment:

1.  If `experiment.variations` has fewer than 2 variations, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
2.  If `context.enabled` is false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
3.  If `context.overrides[experiment.key]` is set, merge override properties into the experiment
4.  If `context.url` contains a querystring `{experiment.key}=[0-9]+`, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId from querystring)
5.  If `context.forcedVariations[experiment.key]` is defined, return immediately (not in experiment, forced variation)
6.  If `experiment.status` is "draft", return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
7.  Get the user hash attribute and value (`context.user[experiment.hashAttribute || "id"]`) and if empty, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
8.  If `experiment.include` is set, call the function and if "false" is returned or it throws, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
9.  If `experiment.groups` is set and none of them are true in `context.groups`, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
10. If `experiment.url` is set, evaluate as a regex against `context.url` and if it doesn't match or throws, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
11. If `experiment.force` is set, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `experiment.force`)
12. If `experiment.status` is "stopped", return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
13. If `context.qaMode` is true, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
14. Compute a hash using the [Fowler–Noll–Vo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) algorithm (specifically fnv32-1a)

    ```js
    n = (fnv32_1a(id + experiment.key) % 1000) / 1000;
    ```

15. Apply coverage to weights:

    ```js
    // Default weights to an even split
    weights = experiment.weights;
    if (!weights) {
      weights = Array(experiment.variations.length).fill(
        1 / experiment.variations.length
      );
    }

    // Multiple each weight by the coverage (or 1 if not set)
    weights = weights.map((w) => w * (experiment.coverage || 1));
    ```

16. Loop through `weights` until you reach the hash value

    ```js
    cumulative = 0;
    assigned = -1;
    for (i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
      cumulative += weights[i];
      if (n < cumulative) {
        assigned = i;
        break;
      }
    }
    ```

17. If not assigned a variation (`assigned === -1`), return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
18. Fire `context.trackingCallback` if set and the combination of hashAttribute, hashValue, experiment.key, and variationId has not been tracked before
19. Return (**in experiment**, assigned variation)

## Remote Config

`context.overrides` allows overriding a subset of experiment properties without changing code. For example, changing an experiment's status from `running` to `stopped`.

The overrides are typically stored in a database or cache so there should be an easy way to pass them in as a JSON-encoded object. The object will look something like this:

```json
{
  "my-experiment-key": {
    "status": "stopped"
  },
  "my-other-experiment": {
    "coverage": 0.5,
    "groups": "beta-testers"
  }
}
```

The full list of supported override properties is:

- weights
- status
- force
- coverage
- groups
- url

Note that the above list specifically does not include `variations`. The only way to change the variations is to change the code.
This restriction makes testing and maintaining code much much easier.

## Developer Experience

Having a good developer experience is super important.

### Basic Usage

It should be very simple to run a basic A/B test:

```js
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "my-experiment",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

print(result.value); // "A" or "B"
```

And it should feel natural to scale up to more complex use cases:

```js
// 50% of beta testers, 80/20 split between variations
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "complex-experiment",
  variations: [
    { color: "blue", size: "small" },
    { color: "green", size: "large" },
  ],
  weights: [0.8, 0.2],
  coverage: 0.5,
  groups: ["beta-testers"],
});

print(result.value.color, result.value.size); // "blue,small" OR "green,large"
```

### Type Hinting

Most languages have some sort of strong typing support, whether in the language itself or via annotations. This helps to reduce errors and is highly encouraged for client libraries.

If possible, use generics to type the return value. If `experiment.variations` is type `T[]`, then `result.value` should be type `T`.

If your type system supports specifying a minimum array length, it's best to type `experiment.variations` as requiring at least 2 elements.

The `experiment.status` field should be typed as a string union or enum if possible. The only valid values are `draft`, `running`, and `stopped`.

### URL Regexes

If your language has support for a native regex type, you should use that instead of strings for `experiment.url`.

However, in all languages, `context.overrides` needs to remain serializeable to JSON, so strings must be used there. When importing overrides from JSON, you would convert the strings to actual regex objects.

Since the regex deals with URLs, make sure you are escaping `/` if needed. The string value `"^/post/[0-9]+"` should work as expected and not throw an error.

### Handling Errors

The general rule is to be strict in development and lenient in production.

You can throw exceptions in development, but someone's production app should never crash because of a call to `growthbook.run`.

For the below edge cases in production, just act as if the problematic property didn't exist and ignore errors:

- `experiment.weights` is a different length from `experiment.variations`
- `experiment.weights` adds up to something other than 1
- `experiment.coverage` is greater than 1
- `context.trackingCallback` throws an error
- URL querystring specifies an invalid variation index

For the below edge cases in production, the experiment should be disabled (everyone gets assigned variation `0`):

- `experiment.url` is an invalid regex
- `experiment.coverage` is less than 0
- `experiment.force` specifies an invalid variation index
- `context.forcedVariations` specifies an invalid variation index
- `experiment.include` throws an error
- `experiment.status` is set to an unknown value
- `experiment.hashAttribute` is an empty string

### Subscriptions

Sometimes it's useful to be able to "subscribe" to a GrowthBook instance and be alerted every time `growthbook.run` is called. This is different from the tracking callback since it also fires when a user is _not_ included in an experiment.

```js
growthbook.subscribe(function (experiment, result) {
  // do something
});
```

It's best to only re-fire the callbacks for an experiment if the result has changed. That means either the `inExperiment` flag has changed or the `variationId` has changed.

If it makes sense for your language, this function should return an "unsubscriber". A simple callback that removes the subscription.

```js
unsubscriber = growthbook.subscribe(...)
unsubscriber()
```

In addition to subscriptions you may also want to expose a `growthbook.getAllResults` method that returns a map of the latest results indexed by experiment key.

### Memory Management

Subscriptions and tracking calls require storing references to many objects and functions. If it makes sense for your language, libraries should provide a `growthbook.destroy` method to remove all of these references and release their memory.

## Tests

We strive to have 100% test coverage for all of our client libraries. Since they all use the same data structures, the test suites are pretty transferrable between languages.

1.  Copy/paste the test suite from an existing client library
2.  Do global search/replace to fix common syntax differences (e.g. replacing `->` in php with `.` in javascript)
3.  Manually fix the rest of the syntax errors and coding patterns
4.  Run the tests!
5.  Go back to step 3 a bunch of times :)
