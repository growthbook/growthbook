# Build Your Own Client Library

This guide is meant for library authors looking to build a GrowthBook client library in a currently unsupported language.

GrowthBook client libraries are very simple and do not interact with the filesystem or network. Because of this, they can often be kept to **under 1000 lines of code**.

All libraries should follow this specification as closely as the language permits to maintain consistency.

## Data structures

There are a number of important data structures in GrowthBook client libraries.

### Condition

Targeting condition based on MongoDB query syntax. This is a recursive JSON object with arbitrary nesting levels. For example:

```ts
{
  "country": "US",
  "browser": {
    "$in": ["firefox", "chrome"]
  },
  "email": {
    "$not": {
      "$regex": "@gmail.com$"
    }
  }
}
```

### Context

Defines the GrowthBook context. At a minimum, the context should support the following optional properties:

- **enabled** (`boolean`) - Switch to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
- **attributes** (`Map`) - Map of user attributes that are used to assign variations
- **url** (`string`) - The URL of the current page
- **features** (`Map`) - Feature definitions (usually pulled from an API or cache)
- **overrides** (`Map`) - Experiment overrides (usually pulled from an API or cache)
- **forcedVariations** (`Map`) - Force specific experiments to always assign a specific variation (used for QA)
- **qaMode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
- **trackingCallback** (`function`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.

Attributes are an arbitrary JSON object containing user and request attributes. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "anonId": "abcdef",
  "company": "growthbook",
  "url": "/pricing",
  "country": "US",
  "browser": "firefox",
  "age": 25,
  "beta": true,
  "account": {
    "plan": "team",
    "seats": 10
  }
}
```

An example of `trackingCallback` in javascript:

```js
function track(experiment, result) {
  analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
    experimentId: experiment.key,
    variationId: result.variationId,
  });
}
```

### Experiment

Defines a single experiment:

- **trackingKey** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **active** (`boolean`) - If set to false, always return the control (first variation)
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **condition** (`Condition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **include** (`() => boolean`) - A callback that returns true if the user should be part of the experiment and false if they should not be
- **namespace** (`(string, number, number)`) - A tuple that contains the namespace identifier, plus a range of coverage for the experiment.
- **force** (`number`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specific variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

The only required properties are `key` and `variations`. Everything else is optional.

### ExperimentResult

The result of running an Experiment given a specific Context

- **inExperiment** (`boolean`) - Whether or not the user is part of the experiment
- **variationId** (`string`) - The array index of the assigned variation
- **value** (`any`) - The array value of the assigned variation
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - The user attribute used to assign a variation
- **hashValue** (`string)` - The value of that attribute

The `variationId` and `value` should always be set, even when `inExperiment` is false.

### ExperimentOverride

`context.overrides` is a JSON object. Keys are experiment trackingKeys and the value is an ExperimentOverride object:

```js
context = {
  "overrides": {
    "key1": {...},
    "key2": {...}
  }
}
```

An ExperimentOverride object is similar to an Experiment object, but only contains a subset of the possible properties:

- weights
- active
- coverage
- condition
- force

### Feature

`context.features` is a JSON object. Keys are unique identifiers for the features and the values are Feature objects.

```js
{
  "feature-1": {...},
  "feature-2": {...},
  "feature-3": {...}
}
```

A Feature object consists of possible values plus rules for how to assign values to users.

- **defaultValue** (`any`) - The default value (should use `null` if not specified)
- **rules** (`Rule[]`) - Array of Rule objects that determine when and how the defaultValue gets overridden

### FeatureRule

- **condition** (`Condition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **coverage** (`number`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **force** (`any`) - Immediately force a specific value (ignore every other option besides condition and coverage)
- **variations** (`any[]`) - Run an experiment (A/B test) and randomly choose between these variations
- **trackingKey** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment (default to the feature key)
- **weights** (`number[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **namespace** (`(string, number, number)`) - A tuple that contains the namespace identifier, plus a range of coverage for the experiment.
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

### FeatureResult

- **value** (`any`) - The assigned value of the feature
- **on** (`boolean`) - The assigned value cast to a boolean
- **off** (`boolean`) - The assigned value cast to a boolean and then negated
- **source** (`enum`) - One of "unknownFeature", "defaultValue", "force", or "experiment"
- **experiment** (`Experiment`) - When source is "experiment", this will be the Experiment object used

## Using the Library

The main export of the libraries is a simple `GrowthBook` wrapper class that takes a `Context` object in the constructor.

It exposes two main methods: `feature` and `run`.

## Evaluating a Feature

The `feature` method takes a single string argument, which is the unique identifier for the feature and returns a `FeatureResult` object.

```js
growthbook = new GrowthBook(context);
myFeature = growthbook.feature("my-feature");
```

There are a few ordered steps to evaluate a feature

1. If the key doesn't exist in `context.features`, return immediately (value = `null`, source = `unknownFeature`).
2. Loop through the feature rules (if any)
   1. If the rule has a `condition` and it evaluates to false, skip this rule and continue to the next one
   2. If `rule.force` is set
      1. If `rule.coverage` is set
         1. Get the user hash value (`context.attributes[rule.hashAttribute || "id"]`) and if empty, skip the rule
         2. Compute a hash using the [Fowler–Noll–Vo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) algorithm (specifically fnv32-1a)
            ```js
            n = (fnv32_1a(hashValue + featureKey) % 1000) / 1000;
            ```
         3. If the hash is greater than `rule.coverage`, skip the rule
      2. Return (value = forced value, source = `force`)
   3. Otherwise, convert the rule to an Experiment object
      ```ts
      const exp = {
        variations: rule.variations,
        trackingKey: rule.trackingKey || featureKey,
      };
      if (rule.coverage) exp.coverage = rule.coverage;
      if (rule.weights) exp.weights = rule.weights;
      if (rule.hashAttribute) exp.hashAttribute = rule.hashAttribute;
      if (rule.namespace) exp.namespace = rule.namespace;
      ```
   4. Run the experiment. If `result.inExperiment` is false, skip this rule and continue to the next one. Otherwise, return immediately (value = assigned variation, source = `experiment`)
3. Return (value = defaultValue or `null`, source = `defaultValue`)

## Running an Experiment

The `run` method takes an Experiment object and returns an `ExperimentResult`:

```js
growthbook = new GrowthBook(context);
result = growthbook.run(experiment);
```

There are a bunch of ordered steps to run an experiment:

1.  If `experiment.variations` has fewer than 2 variations, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
2.  If `context.enabled` is false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
3.  If `context.overrides[experiment.trackingKey]` is set, merge override properties into the experiment
4.  If `context.url` contains a querystring `{experiment.trackingKey}=[0-9]+`, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId from querystring)
5.  If `context.forcedVariations[experiment.trackingKey]` is defined, return immediately (not in experiment, forced variation)
6.  If `experiment.action` is set to false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
7.  Get the user hash attribute and value (`context.attributes[experiment.hashAttribute || "id"]`) and if empty, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
8.  If `experiment.namespace` is set, check if hash value is included in the range and if not, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
9.  If `experiment.include` is set, call the function and if "false" is returned or it throws, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
10. If `experiment.condition` is set and the condition evaluates to false, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
11. Default variation weights and coverage if not specified

    ```js
    // Default weights to an even split between all variations
    weights = experiment.weights;
    if (!weights) {
      weights = Array(experiment.variations.length).fill(
        1 / experiment.variations.length
      );
    }

    // Default coverage to 1 (100%)
    coverage = experiment.coverage ?? 1;
    ```

12. Calculate bucket ranges for the variations

    ```js
    // Convert weights/coverage to ranges
    // 50/50 split at 100% coverage == [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 1]]
    // 20/80 split with 50% coverage == [[0, 0.1], [0.2, 0.6]]
    cumulative = 0;
    ranges = weights.map((w) => {
      start = cumulative;
      cumulative += w;
      return [start, start + coverage * w];
    });
    ```

13. Compute a hash using the [Fowler–Noll–Vo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) algorithm (specifically fnv32-1a) and assign a variation

    ```js
    n = (fnv32_1a(id + experiment.key) % 1000) / 1000;

    assigned = -1;
    ranges.forEach((range, i) => {
      if (n >= range[0] && n < range[1]) {
        assigned = i;
      }
    });
    ```

14. If not assigned a variation (`assigned === -1`), return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
15. If `experiment.force` is set, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `experiment.force`)
16. If `context.qaMode` is true, return immediately (not in experiment, variationId `0`)
17. Fire `context.trackingCallback` if set and the combination of hashAttribute, hashValue, experiment.key, and variationId has not been tracked before
18. Return (**in experiment**, assigned variation)

## Evaluating Conditions

Both experiments and features can define targeting conditions using a syntax modeled after MongoDB queries.

These conditions can have arbitrary nesting levels and evaluating them requires recursion. There are a handful of functions to define, and be aware that some of them may reference function definitions further below.

### evalCondition(attributes, conditionObj): boolean

This is the main function used to evaluate a condition.

1. If conditionObj has a key `$or`, return `evalOr(attributes, condition["$or"])`
2. If conditionObj has a key `$nor`, return `!evalOr(attributes, condition["$nor"])`
3. If conditionObj has a key `$and`, return `!evalAnd(attributes, condition["$and"])`
4. If conditionObj has a key `$not`, return `!evalCondition(attributes, condition["$not"])`
5. Loop through the conditionObj key/value pairs
   1. If `evalConditionValue(value, getPath(attributes, key))` is false, break out of loop and return false
6. Return true

### evalOr(attributes, conditionObjs): boolean

`conditionObjs` is an array of parsed condition objects

1. If conditionObjs is empty, return true
2. Loop through the conditionObjects
   1. If `evalCondition(attributes, conditionObjs[i])` is true, break out of the loop and return true
3. Return false

### evalAnd(attributes, conditionObjs): boolean

`conditionObjs` is an array of parsed condition objects

1. Loop through the conditionObjects
   1. If `evalCondition(attributes, conditionObjs[i])` is false, break out of the loop and return false
2. Return true

### isOperatorObject(obj): boolean

This accepts a parsed JSON object as input and returns `true` if every key in the object starts with `$`.

- `{"$gt": 1}` -> `true`
- `{"$gt": 1, "$lt": 10}` -> `true`
- `{"foo": "bar"}` -> `false`
- `{"$gt": 1, "foo": "bar"}` -> `false`

### getType(attributeValue): string

This returns the data type of the passed in argument.

The valid types to return are:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `array`
- `object`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `unknown`

The difference between `null` and `undefined` can be illustrated as follows:

```ts
obj = JSON.parse('{"foo": null}');

getType(obj["foo"]); // null

getType(obj["bar"]); // undefined
```

The value `unknown` is there just in case you can't figure out the data type for whatever reason. It will never be used in most implementations.

### getPath(attributes, path): any

Given attributes and a dot-separated path string, return the value at that path (or `null`/`undefined` if the path doesn't exist)

Given the input:

```json
{
  "name": "john",
  "job": {
    "title": "developer"
  }
}
```

It should return:

- `getPath(input, "name")` -> `"john"`
- `getPath(input, "job.title")` -> `"developer"`
- `getPath(input, "job.company")` -> `null` or `undefined`

### evalConditionValue(conditionValue, attributeValue): boolean

1. If `conditionValue` is a string, number, boolean, or array, return true if it's "equal" to `attributeValue` and false if not. "equal" should do a deep comparison for arrays.
2. If `conditionValue` is an object, loop over each key/value pair:
   1. If `evalOperatorCondition(key, attributeValue, value)` is false, return false
3. Return true

### elemMatch(condition, attributeValue): boolean

This checks if `attributeValue` is an array, and if so at least one of the array items must match the condition

1. If `attributeValue` is not an array, return false
2. Loop through items in `attributeValue`
3. If `isOperatorObject(condition)`
4. If `evalConditionValue(condition, item)`, break out of loop and return true
5. Else if `evalCondition(item, condition)`, break out of loop and return true
6. Return false

### evalOperatorCondition(operator, attributeValue, conditionValue)

This function is just a case statement that handles all the possible operators

There are basic comparison operators in the form `attributeValue {op} conditionValue`:

- `$eq` ==
- `$ne` != (not equals)
- `$lt` &lt;
- `$lte` &lt;=
- `$gt` &gt;
- `$gte` &gt;=
- `$regex` ~ (regex match)

There are 2 operators where conditionValue is an array:

- `$in`
  1. Return true if attributeValue in the conditionValue array, false otherwise
- `$nin`
  1. Return false if attributeValue in the conditionValue array, true otherwise

There are 2 operators where attributeValue is an array:

- `$elemMatch`
  1. Return `elemMatch(conditionValue, attributeValue)`
- `$size`
  1.  If attributeValue is not an array, return false
  2.  Return `evalConditionValue(conditionValue, attributeValue.length)`

There is 1 operator where both attributeValue and conditionValue are arrays:

- `$all`
  1. If attributeValue is not an array, return false
  2. Loop through conditionValue array
     1. If none of the elements in the attributeValue array pass `evalConditionValue(conditionValue[i], attributeValue[j])`, return false
  3. Return true

There are 3 other operators:

- `$exists`
  1. If conditionValue is false, return true if attributeValue is null or undefined
  2. Else, return true if attributeValue is NOT null or undefined
  3. Return false by default
- `$type`
  1. Return `getType(attributeValue) == conditionValue`
- `$not`
  1. Return `!evalConditionValue(conditionValue, attributeValue)`

If operator doesn't match any of these, return false and potentially log the error for debug purposes.

## Developer Experience

Having a good developer experience is super important.

### Basic Usage

It should be extremely easy and natural to use features, both on/off flags and full remote config features.

```js
// On/off flag
if (growthbook.feature("my-feature").on) {
  // ...
}

// Remote config
color = growthbook.feature("signup-button-color").value || "blue";
```

The developer doesn't need to care how the value of a feature was determined, whether it came from a default, an experiment, or through complex targeting rules.

In most cases, this is all the developer will ever need to do. If they do need to run an inline experiment, it should be very simple to run a basic A/B test:

```js
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "my-experiment",
  variations: ["A", "B"],
});

print(result.value); // "A" or "B"
```

And it should feel natural to scale up to more complex use cases:

```js
// 50% of beta testers, 80/20 split between variations
result = growthbook.run({
  key: "complex-experiment",
  variations: [
    { color: "blue", size: "small" },
    { color: "green", size: "large" },
  ],
  weights: [0.8, 0.2],
  coverage: 0.5,
  condition: {
    beta: true,
  },
});

print(result.value.color, result.value.size);
// "blue,small" OR "green,large"
```

### Type Hinting

Most languages have some sort of strong typing support, whether in the language itself or via annotations. This helps to reduce errors and is highly encouraged for client libraries.

If possible, use generics to type the return value. If `experiment.variations` is type `T[]`, then `result.value` should be type `T`.

If your type system supports specifying a minimum array length, it's best to type `experiment.variations` as requiring at least 2 elements.

### Handling Errors

The general rule is to be strict in development and lenient in production.

You can throw exceptions in development, but someone's production app should never crash because of a call to `growthbook.feature` or `growthbook.run`.

For the below edge cases in production, just act as if the problematic property didn't exist and ignore errors:

- `experiment.weights` is a different length from `experiment.variations`
- `experiment.weights` adds up to something other than 1
- `experiment.coverage` is greater than 1
- `context.trackingCallback` throws an error
- URL querystring specifies an invalid variation index

For the below edge cases in production, the experiment should be disabled (everyone gets assigned variation `0`):

- `experiment.url` is an invalid regex
- `experiment.coverage` is less than 0
- `experiment.force` specifies an invalid variation index
- `context.forcedVariations` specifies an invalid variation index
- `experiment.include` throws an error
- `experiment.hashAttribute` is an empty string

### Subscriptions

Sometimes it's useful to be able to "subscribe" to a GrowthBook instance and be alerted every time `growthbook.run` is called. This is different from the tracking callback since it also fires when a user is _not_ included in an experiment.

```js
growthbook.subscribe(function (experiment, result) {
  // do something
});
```

It's best to only re-fire the callbacks for an experiment if the result has changed. That means either the `inExperiment` flag has changed or the `variationId` has changed.

If it makes sense for your language, this function should return an "unsubscriber". A simple callback that removes the subscription.

```js
unsubscriber = growthbook.subscribe(...)
unsubscriber()
```

In addition to subscriptions you may also want to expose a `growthbook.getAllResults` method that returns a map of the latest results indexed by experiment key.

### Memory Management

Subscriptions and tracking calls require storing references to many objects and functions. If it makes sense for your language, libraries should provide a `growthbook.destroy` method to remove all of these references and release their memory.

## Tests

We strive to have 100% test coverage for all of our client libraries.

There are language-agnostic test suites stored as JSON files in `packages/sdk-js/test/cases/`. This covers things like hashing, feature rules, variation assignment, and evaluating conditions. The files are arrays of test cases. Each test case is an array and the order/meaning of array items depends on the file:

- `conditions.json` - tests for `evalCondition`
  - name of the test case (string)
  - expected return value (boolean)
  - condition
  - attributes
- `features.json` - tests for `growthbook.feature()`
  - name of the test case (string)
  - context passed into GrowthBook constructor
  - name of the feature (string)
  - expected result
- `fnv.json` - tests for `hashFnv32a(value) % 1000`
  - value to hash (string)
  - expected result (number)
- `experiments.json` - tests for `growthbook.run()`
  - name of the test case (string)
  - context passed into GrowthBook constructor
  - experiment object
  - expected value
  - inExperiment (boolean)

In addition to the above, you should write custom test cases for things like event subscriptions, tracking callbacks, constructor args, etc. that are more language-specific.
