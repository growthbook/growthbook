## Installation

`pip install growthbook` (recommended) or copy `growthbook.py` into your project

## Quick Usage

```python
from growthbook import GrowthBook, Experiment

userId = "123"

def on_experiment_viewed(experiment, result):
  # Use whatever event tracking system you want
  analytics.track(userId, "Experiment Viewed", {
    'experimentId': experiment.key,
    'variationId': result.variationId
  })

gb = GrowthBook(
  user = {"id": userId},
  trackingCallback = on_experiment_viewed
)

result = gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "my-experiment",
  variations = ["A", "B"]
))

print(result.value) # "A" or "B"
```

## GrowthBook class

The GrowthBook constructor has the following parameters:

- **enabled** (`boolean`) - Flag to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
- **user** (`dict`) - Dictionary of user attributes that are used to assign variations
- **groups** (`dict`) - A dictionary of which groups the user belongs to (key is the group name, value is boolean)
- **url** (`string`) - The URL of the current request (if applicable)
- **overrides** (`dict`) - Nested dictionary of experiment property overrides (used for Remote Config)
- **forcedVariations** (`dict`) - Dictionary of forced experiment variations (used for QA)
- **qaMode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
- **trackingCallback** (`callable`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.

## Experiment class

Below are all of the possible properties you can set for an Experiment:

- **key** (`string`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment
- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between
- **weights** (`float[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **status** (`string`) - "running" is the default and always active. "draft" is only active during QA and development. "stopped" is only active when forcing a winning variation to 100% of users.
- **coverage** (`float`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **url** (`string`) - Users can only be included in this experiment if the current URL matches this regex
- **include** (`callable`) - A function that returns true if the user should be part of the experiment and false if they should not be
- **groups** (`string[]`) - Limits the experiment to specific user groups
- **force** (`int`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specified variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to "id")

## Running Experiments

Run experiments by calling `gb.run(experiment)` which returns an object with a few useful properties:

```python
result = gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "my-experiment",
  variations = ["A", "B"]
))

# If user is part of the experiment
print(result.inExperiment) # true or false

# The index of the assigned variation
print(result.variationId) # 0 or 1

# The value of the assigned variation
print(result.value) # "A" or "B"

# The user attribute used to assign a variation
print(result.hashAttribute) # "id"

# The value of that attribute
print(result.hashValue) # e.g. "123"
```

The `inExperiment` flag is only set to true if the user was randomly assigned a variation. If the user failed any targeting rules or was forced into a specific variation, this flag will be false.

### Example Experiments

3-way experiment with uneven variation weights:

```python
gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "3-way-uneven",
  variations = ["A","B","C"],
  weights = [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]
))
```

Slow rollout (10% of users who opted into "beta" features):

```python
# User is in the "qa" and "beta" groups
gb = GrowthBook(
  user = {"id": "123"},
  groups = {
    "qa": isQATester(),
    "beta": betaFeaturesEnabled()
  }
)

gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "slow-rollout",
  variations = ["A", "B"],
  coverage = 0.1,
  groups = ["beta"]
))
```

Complex variations and custom targeting

```python
result = gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "complex-variations",
  variations = [
    {'color': "blue", 'size': "large"},
    {'color': "green", 'size': "small"}
  ],
  url = "^/post/[0-9]+$"
  include = lambda: isPremium or creditsRemaining > 50
))

# Either "blue,large" OR "green,small"
print(result.value["color"] + "," + result.value["size"])
```

Assign variations based on something other than user id

```python
gb = GrowthBook(
  user = {
    "id": "123",
    "company": "growthbook"
  }
)

gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "by-company-id",
  variations = ["A", "B"],
  hashAttribute = "company"
))

# Users in the same company will always get the same variation
```

### Overriding Experiment Configuration

It's common practice to adjust experiment settings after a test is live. For example, slowly ramping up traffic, stopping a test automatically if guardrail metrics go down, or rolling out a winning variation to 100% of users.

For example, to roll out a winning variation to 100% of users:

```python
gb = GrowthBook(
  user = {"id": "123"},
  overrides = {
    "experiment-key": {
      "status": "stopped",
      "force": 1
    }
  }
)

result = gb.run(Experiment(
  key = "experiment-key",
  variations = ["A", "B"]
))

print(result.value) # Always "B"
```

The full list of experiment properties you can override is:

- status
- force
- weights
- coverage
- groups
- url

If you use the Growth Book App (https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) to manage experiments, there's a built-in API endpoint you can hit that returns overrides in this exact format. It's a great way to make sure your experiments are always up-to-date.

### Django

For Django (and other web frameworks), we recommend adding a simple middleware where you instantiate the GrowthBook object

```python
from growthbook import GrowthBook

def growthbook_middleware(get_response):
    def middleware(request):
        request.gb = GrowthBook(
          # ...
        )
        response = get_response(request)

        request.gb.destroy() # Cleanup

        return response
    return middleware
```

Then, you can easily run an experiment in any of your views:

```python
from growthbook import Experiment

def index(request):
    result = request.gb.run(Experiment(
      # ...
    ))
    # ...
```

## Event Tracking and Analyzing Results

This library only handles assigning variations to users. The 2 other parts required for an A/B testing platform are Tracking and Analysis.

### Tracking

It's likely you already have some event tracking on your site with the metrics you want to optimize (Segment, Mixpanel, etc.).

For A/B tests, you just need to track one additional event - when someone views a variation.

```python
# Specify a tracking callback when instantiating the client
gb = GrowthBook(
  user = {"id": "123"},
  trackingCallback = on_experiment_viewed
})
```

Below are examples for a few popular event tracking tools:

#### Segment

```python
def on_experiment_viewed(experiment, result):
  analytics.track(userId, "Experiment Viewed", {
    'experimentId': experiment.key,
    'variationId': result.variationId
  })
```

#### Mixpanel

```python
def on_experiment_viewed(experiment, result):
  mp.track(userId, "$experiment_started", {
    'Experiment name': experiment.key,
    'Variant name': result.variationId
  })
```
