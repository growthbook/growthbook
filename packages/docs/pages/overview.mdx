# How it works

GrowthBook's feature flagging and experimentation platform is built for maximum flexibility and performance, and as such,
works a bit differently than others. This page will go over how it all works together, and some of the common usage modes.

#### TL;DR:

At it's core, GrowthBook's feature flagging system produces file which is processed by the SDK to figure out which
user sees which feature. If a feature is set up as an experiment, a tracking call will fire to your existing event tracking
system to add this exposure data to your data warehouse.

GrowthBook's experiments analyzes raw experiment data in your data warehouse, and runs statistical modeling to produce a
report of the results. No raw event data is sent to GrowthBook, instead, we require read only access to your data. The
experiment analysis can be used with feature flagging, or entirely separate as the statistics and reporting tool for your
own experiment data.

## Feature Flagging

[Feature flags](/app/features) allow you to decouple the deployment of code, from the release of the feature. At it's simplest a feature
flag is an on/off toggle for your feature. However, they can be far more useful than this. All flags have a **value**,
that are passed to the code from the UI, and **rules**, which determine who gets to see it. With this, feature flags are extremely flexible. You can slowly roll out a
feature, target a feature to certain users, quickly adjust the text on a page, or easily turn a feature into an A/B test to measure its impact.

For the [**values**](/app/features#feature-types) the options are:

- **Boolean** - A simple on/off flag. Useful if you just want to toggle a feature
- **Number** - A number will be passed as the value of the flag to the code
- **String** - A text string will be passed to the code
- **JSON** - A custom json object containing arbitrary keys and values

On top of the flag type, you can add behavior [**rules**](/app/features#override-rules) are attached to the flag. You can add as many rules as you like, and
the first matching rules is used. The rule types are:

- **Simple** - All users get the same value
- **Targeted** - Choose which users get to see the feature flag
- **Percentage Rollout** - A certain percentage of users will get to see the feature. Useful for de-risking feature deploys
- **A/B Experiment** - Run an A/B test between different values of the flag

The result of these flags are a JSON file with all the rules and states. This file can be served directly from your servers,
our CDN (if you're using cloud), or cache it locally for faster performance. This file processed by the [SDKs](/lib) along with the
[user attributes](/app/features#targeting-attributes) to evaluate what features are shown to the user. You can read more details
about [features here](/app/features).

## Experiments

Experiments with the GrowthBook pull data from your existing data source. We support most major [data sources](/app/datasources),
including BigQuery, Redshift, and even Mixpanel, and Google Analytics.

Once you create a read only connection to your data source you have to tell GrowthBook how to find [experiment exposure](app/datasources#1-experiments-query) information,
[page view](/app/datasources#2-page-views-query) information (or screens for mobile), and then define [metrics](/app/metrics).

When these queries are defined, you can use GrowthBook to analyze the results of any experiment data that exists in your
data warehouse. GrowthBook creates a combined query to pull aggregate experiment information from your data source (you can click _view queries_ to see them).
This is run through our [Bayesian statistics engine](/statistics) to show you results. In this way no PII leaves your servers,
and you get a single source of truth for your data.

## Experiment use cases

There are a few ways to use GrowthBook for experiments: with **feature flags**, **webhooks**, or as a **Reporting Platform**:

#### Feature Flags

As described above, you can create a feature flags and attach an experiment rule. When the flag evaluated in this state,
it will fire the [**tracking callback**](/lib/js#tracking-callback) so you can pass the event and exposure info back to
your warehouse. Learn more about feature and [SDK](/lib) [integration here](/app/features#integration-options).

#### Webhooks

You can define webhooks in the GrowthBook UI to fire whenever an experiment state changes. With this you can pull in
experiment changes either manually or using one of our [SDKs](/lib). Learn more about the [webhooks here](/app/webhooks).

#### Reporting Platform

If you already have your own way of doing variation assignment and data collection, you can use GrowthBook to do the
reporting on the results. GrowthBook allows you to easily see and import any new experiments that are in your data base
and automates a lot of the hard parts of doing experiment analysis.
