# GrowthBook Technical Overview

GrowthBook's feature flagging and experimentation system is built for maximum flexibility and performance, and as such,
works a bit differently than others. This page will go over how it all works together, and some of the common usage modes.

#### TL;DR:

At it's core, GrowthBook's feature flagging system produces a JSON file which is processed by the SDK to figure out which
user sees which feature. If a feature is set up as an experiment, a tracking call will fire to your existing event tracking
system to add this exposure data to your data warehouse.

GrowthBook's experiments analyzes raw experiment data in your data warehouse, and runs statistical modeling to produce a
report of the results. No raw event data is sent to GrowthBook, instead, we require read only access to your data. The
experiment analysis can be used with feature flagging, or entirely separate as the statistics and reporting tool for your
own experiment data.

## Feature Flagging

Feature flags allow you to decouple the deployment of code, from the release of the feature. You can choose how and when
to release it to your users: slowly roll out a feature, target who gets to see it, or easily turn it into an experiment-
all from the GrowthBook UI.

When you make a new feature flag, you specify what type of flag it is. The options are:

- Boolean - A simple on/off flag. Useful if you just want to toggle a feature
- Number - A number will be passed as the value of the flag to the code
- String - A text string will be passed to the code
- JSON - A custom json object containing arbitrary keys and values

On top of the flag type, you can add behavior rules are attached to the flag. You can add as many rules as you like, and
the first matching rules is used. The rule types are:

- Simple - All users get the same value
- Targeted - Choose which users get to see the feature flag
- Percentage rollout - A certain percentage of users will get to see the feature. Useful for de-risking feature deploys
- A/B Experiment - Run an A/B test between different values of the flag

The result of these flags are a json file with all the rules and states. This is processed by the SDKs along with the user attributes to evaluate what
features are shown to the user. You can read more details about features here.
