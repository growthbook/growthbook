# GrowthBook Docs

GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and a/b testing built for data teams, engineers, and product managers.
It's great whether you're looking to just analyze experiment results or looking to make it easier to deploy code.

## Our Mission

Companies spend thousands of hours building internal tools for feature flagging and experimentation (A/B testing).
They do this in part because they want to run these systems on their own infrastructure, using their own data, and have them deeply integrated into their code.

GrowthBook gives data, engineering, and product teams the power of a customizable platform without needing to build it yourself.

We believe that **feature flagging** is the best way to deploy features and easily adopt an experimentation culture.

We believe A/B testing should sit on top of your **existing data and metrics**, wherever they live and however they are defined.

We believe in **data transparency**. You can export results as a Jupyter notebook and our Bayesian stats engine is developed out in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/tree/main/packages/stats).

We are fanatical about **performance**. Our [SDKs](/lib) are crazy fast and light-weight and evaluate everything locally with no network requests.

We believe good ideas come from everywhere. GrowthBook gives you feature flags so its easy to **test everything** and make experimentation part of your process.
