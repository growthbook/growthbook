# Growth Book Docs

Growth Book is split into 2 parts: the **Growth Book App** and **Client Libraries**.

The [Growth Book App](/app) is where you manage your A/B tests and analyze results.

The [Client Libraries](/lib) are how you actually implement the A/B tests in your application.

Use the menu or the Previous/Next links at the bottom to navigate.
