![GrowthBook: The Open Source A/B Testing Platform](/images/hero.png)

## Our Philosophy

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours building their own A/B testing platforms in-house.
The other 99% are left paying for expensive 3rd party SaaS tools or hacking together unmaintained open source libraries.

GrowthBook gives you the flexibility and power of a fully-featured in-house A/B testing platform without needing to build it yourself.

We believe A/B testing should sit on top of your **existing data and metrics**, wherever they live and however they are defined.

We believe in **data transparency**. You can export results as a Jupyter notebook and our Bayesian stats engine is developed out in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/tree/main/packages/stats).

We are fanatical about **performance**. Our [Client Libraries](/lib) are crazy fast and light-weight and evaluate everything locally with no network requests.

We believe good ideas come from everywhere. GrowthBook gives you **access controls** and guardrails to safely open up A/B testing to your entire organization.
