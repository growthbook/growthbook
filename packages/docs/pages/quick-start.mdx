# Quick Start

Get started using the Growth Book experimentation platform 
in just a few minutes.

1.  Add a metric
2.  Define an experiment
3.  Start the experiment
4.  View results
5.  Next Steps

## Add a metric

Metrics are what you are trying to change with experimentation.
For example, newsletter signups, revenue, or unsubscribe rate.

For this example, we are going to imagine optimizing a pricing page for 
a SaaS product.  The metrics we'll use are `Viewed Checkout` and `Subscribed`.

To start, click on Metrics in the site menu.

1.  Click the green "`+ Add Metric`" button
2.  For metric name, enter "`Viewed Checkout`"
3.  Keep the conversion type set to "`Binomial`" since this metric only has 2 possible values - yes or no
4.  Click the Save button

Repeat the above to add a 2nd metric "`Subscribed`", which is also binomial.

## Define an experiment

Experiments are the actual AB tests you run.  In the site menu, click on Experiments and then the New Experiment button in the top right.

Fill out the following info and click the Create button.

-  **Name**: Pricing Display
-  **Hypothesis**: Showing the per-month price instead will reduce sticker shock and increase conversions.
-  **Metrics**: *select both metrics created earlier*
-  **Control Name**: Annual
-  **Variation 1 Name**: Monthly

## Start the Experiment

Click the newly created experiment name to go to the details page.

Click the "Start" button next to the experiment title.

Experiments go through 1 or more *phases*.  For this example, we're just going to have a single *main* phase with 
100% of traffic split evenly between the variations.

Accept the default values in the form and click "Start".

At this point, you would implement the changes on your site using one of our Client Libraries and collect data for a while.  
For this example, we'll just fast forward and assume we already did that.

## View Results

Start by clicking the new Results tab on the experiment page.

Click the "Update Data" button and fill in the following info:

| Metric           | Annual | Monthly |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| Users            | 5024   | 5067    |
| Viewed Checkout  | 1032   | 1156    |
| Subscribed       | 356    | 361     |

Click Submit to save the data.

Our change got more people to start checking out, but did 
not result in any increase in subscriptions.  Let's stop the experiment and add our notes:

Click the "Stop Experiment" button and fill in the following info:

-  **Conclusion**: Inconclusive
-  **Addition Analysis**: Increased checkouts, but not subscriptions. Users may have viewed this as a bait and switch.

Click the "Stop" button to end the experiment and save your comments.

## Next Steps

-  Connect a [Data Source](/sources) to pull experiment results automatically
-  Use our [JavaScript](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-js), [React](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-react), [PHP](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-php), or [Ruby](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-ruby) client libraries to implement AB test changes on your site.
