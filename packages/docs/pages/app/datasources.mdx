# Data Sources

Data Sources are how GrowthBook connects to your analytics tool or data warehouse to automatically pull metrics and experiment results.

You can use GrowthBook without a Data Source, but the user experience is not as smooth since you must enter all data manually.

Below are the currently supported Data Sources:

- Redshift
- Snowflake
- BigQuery
- ClickHouse
- AWS Athena
- Postgres
- MySQL/MariaDB
- PrestoDB (and Trino)
- Mixpanel
- Google Analytics

## Configuration Settings

To effectively use GrowthBook, you'll need to tell us a little about the shape of your data.

### SQL Sources

GrowthBook can work with your existing SQL data, no matter what shape or format it is in, whether you have a strongly normalized schema, a single “events” table with JSON fields, or something in between.

#### Predefined Schemas

GrowthBook supports a few popular database schemas out-of-the-box:

- Segment
- Snowplow
- RudderStack
- Amplitude (Snowflake only)
- Google Analytics 4 (BigQuery only)

After connecting to your data source, you will be prompted to choose one of the above. If your data is in a different format, you can also decide to define a custom schema.

#### Custom Schemas

GrowthBook just needs you to write a couple SQL queries in order to query your data. Writing this SQL is a (mostly) one-time setup task. After building out this library of queries, they can easily be reused across many experiments.

Don’t worry about the potentially huge number of rows returned by these raw queries. They are never run directly as-is and are instead combined, filtered, and aggregated as part of larger queries. Most of the final queries run by GrowthBook result in fewer than 10 rows returned.

In the spirit of transparency, any time a query is run, you should see a `View Queries` link in the app to view the raw SQL sent to the data warehouse. This can help with debugging or let you move a query into a tool like Mode Analytics for more advanced analysis.

##### Experiments Query

This query needs to return which user was part of which experiment, what variation they saw, and when they saw it. The end result of the query should return data like this:

| user_id | anonymous_id | timestamp           | experiment_id  | variation_id |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 123     | abcdef       | 2021-08-23-10:53:04 | my-button-test | 0            |
| 456     | fedcba       | 2021-08-23 10:53:06 | my-button-test | 1            |

As an example, if you use Segment to populate your data warehouse, the SQL will look something like this:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  anonymous_id,
  received_at as timestamp,
  experiment_id,
  variation_id
FROM
  experiment_viewed
```

If you have all of your events in a single denormalized table, the query will be similar with the addition of a WHERE clause to filter down to just the variation assignment event type. If you have a custom data structure, you may even need to also add some JOINs.

Don’t worry about returning duplicate rows or ordering the result. We handle that for you automatically. Whatever you do, just make sure to return the exact column names shown above. If your table’s columns use a different name, add an alias in the SELECT list (e.g. `SELECT original_column as new_column`).

##### Experiment Dimensions

In addition to the standard 5 columns above, you can return additional dimension columns. For example, `browser` or `referrer`. These extra columns can be used to drill down into experiment results.

##### User Id Join Tables

In some cases, we may need a use an additional join table between anonymous ids and logged-in user ids. For example, if an experiment is only running for anonymous users, but the conversion metric table only has logged-in user ids.

This query is very simple and just needs to return 2 columns: `user_id` and `anonymous_id`. Here's an example using Segment's schema:

```sql
SELECT user_id, anonymous_id FROM identifies
```

##### SQL Template Variables

Within your queries, there are several placeholder variables you can use. These will be replaced with strings before being run. This can be useful for giving hints to SQL optimization engines to improve query performance.

The variables are:

- **startDate** - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` of the earliest data that needs to be included
- **startYear** - Just the `YYYY` of the startDate
- **startMonth** - Just the `MM` of the startDate
- **startDay** - Just the `DD` of the startDate
- **endDate** - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` of the latest data that needs to be included
- **endYear** - Just the `YYYY` of the endDate
- **endMonth** - Just the `MM` of the endDate
- **endDay** - Just the `DD` of the endDate

For example:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  anonymous_id,
  received_at as timestamp,
  experiment_id,
  variation_id
FROM
  experiment_viewed
WHERE
  received_at BETWEEN '{{ startDate }}' AND '{{ endDate }}'
```

**Note:** The inserted values do not have surrounding quotes, so you must add those yourself (e.g. use `'{{ startDate }}'` instead of just `{{ startDate }}`)

#### Jupyter Notebook Query Runner

This setting is only required if you want to export experiment results as a Jupyter Notebook.

There is no one standard way to store credentials or run SQL queries from Jupyter notebooks, so GrowthBook lets you define your own Python function.

It needs to be called `runQuery`, accept a single string argument named `sql`, and return a pandas data frame.

Here's an example for a Postgres (or Redshift) data source:

```python
import os
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

# Use environment variables or similar for passwords!
password = os.getenv('POSTGRES_PW')
connStr = f'postgresql+psycopg2://user:{password}@localhost'
dbConnection = create_engine(connStr).connect();

def runQuery(sql):
  return pd.read_sql(text(sql), dbConnection)
```

**Note:** This python source is stored as plain text in the database. Do not hard-code passwords or sensitive info. Use environment variables (shown above) or another credential store instead.

### Mixpanel

We query Mixpanel using JQL. We have sensible defaults for the event and property names, but you can change them if you need to.

- Experiments
  - **View Experiments Event** - The name of the event you are firing when a user is put into a variation
  - **Experiment Id Property** - The property name that stores the experiment tracking key
  - **Variation Id Property** - The property name that stores the variation the user was assigned
  - **Variation Id Format** - What format the variation id is stored in.
    1.  Numeric (0 = control, 1 = variation 1, etc.)
    2.  Unique String Keys (e.g. "blue", "random-uuid", etc.)

Below is an example of what your Mixpanel tracking call would look like in Javascript using our default settings:

```js
// Tracking Callback for GrowthBook SDK
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  ...,
  trackingCallback: function(experiment, result) {
    mixpanel.track("$experiment_started", {
      "Experiment name": experiment.key,
      "Variant name":  result.variationId
    })
  }
})
```

When we query Mixpanel, we group users by `distinct_id`. We recommend passing this into the GrowthBook SDK as the user attribute `id`. This varies by platform, but below is a javascript example:

```js
// Can only get the distinct_id after Mixpanel fully loads
mixpanel.init("YOUR PROJECT TOKEN", {
  loaded: function (mixpanel) {
    growthbook.setAttributes({
      ...growthbook.getAttributes(),
      id: mixpanel.get_distinct_id(),
    });
  },
});
```

## Connection Info

Connection info is encrypted twice - once within the app and again by the database when persisting to disk.

GrowthBook only runs `SELECT` queries (or the equivalent for non-SQL data sources). We still always recommend creating read-only users with as few permissions as possible.

If you are using GrowthBook Cloud (https://app.growthbook.io), make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40` if applicable.

Most data sources have straight forward connection parameters like host, port, username, password. A few of the data sources, documented below, require some extra work to connect.

### AWS Athena

Unlike other database engines with their own user management system, Athena uses IAM for authentication.

We recommend creating a new IAM user with readonly permissions for GrowthBook. The managed [Quick Sight Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy.html) is a good starting point.

For the S3 results url, we recommend naming your bucket with the prefix `aws-athena-query-results-`

### BigQuery

You must first create a Service Account in Google with the proper permissions. To connect GrowthBook, we just need the JSON key file for that account.
It should contain the project_id, client_email, and private_key.

### Mixpanel

You must first create a Service Account in Mixpanel under your [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project#serviceaccounts).

To add the datasource in GrowthBook, you will need:

1.  The service account username
2.  The service account secret
3.  Your project id (found on the Project Settings Overview page)

### Google Analytics

**Note:** The Google Analytics data source only support the older Universal Analytics properties. If you are using Google Analytics v4 property, you need to [setup a BigQuery export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238) and use that as the data source instead.

Because of Universal Analytics tracking limitations, a user can only be in a single experiment at a time. We highly recommend using a more full-featured data source for serious A/B testing.

We require 4 things to query the Universal Analytics API:

1.  OAuth Authorization
2.  View ID (found in Admin -> View Settings)
3.  Custom Dimension Index
4.  Custom Dimension Delimiter (defaults to `:`)

When tracking experiment views, the custom dimension value must be formatted as `{experiment-key}{delimiter}{variation-index}`. For example: `my-test:0` for the control and `my-test:1` for the 1st variation.
