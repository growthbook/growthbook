# Data Sources

Data Sources are how Growth Book connects to your analytics tool or data warehouse to automatically pull metrics and experiment results.

You can use Growth Book without a Data Source, but the user experience is not as smooth since you must enter all data manually.

Below are the currently supported Data Sources:

-  Redshift
-  Snowflake
-  BigQuery
-  AWS Athena
-  Postgres
-  Mixpanel
-  Google Analytics

## Configuration Settings

To effectively use Growth Book, you'll need to tell us a little about the shape of your data.

### SQL Sources

To query SQL data warehouses, we need 3 core SELECT statements. 
The default values assume you are using Segment to populate your data warehouse, although you can customize the SQL at any time.

Growth Book combines these queries as needed and adds filters/grouping on top of them using Common Table Expressions (CTEs). 
Any time a query is run, you should see a `View Queries` link in the app to view the raw SQL sent to the data warehouse.

#### 1. Experiments Query

This SELECT statment is used to pull experiment variation assignments.  There should be one row every time a user is put into an experiment along with the variation they were assigned.

Default value:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  anonymous_id,
  received_at as timestamp,
  experiment_id,
  variation_id,
  context_page_path as url,
  context_user_agent as user_agent
FROM
  experiment_viewed
```

#### 2. Users Query

This SELECT statment is used to join users to anonymous sessions from before they logged in. It should return a mapping from anonymous_id to user_id.
Most user_ids should have at least 1 associated anonymous_id for this to work properly.

Default value:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  anonymous_id
FROM
  identifies
```

#### 3. Page Views Query

This SELECT statment is used to predict running time before an experiment starts. It does this by looking at historical traffic to the pages where your experiment will run.

Default value:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  anonymous_id,
  received_at as timestamp,
  path as url,
  context_user_agent as user_agent
FROM
  pages
```

### Mixpanel

We query Mixpanel using JQL.  We have sensible defaults for the event and property names, but you can change them if you need to.

- Experiments
  -  **View Experiments Event** - The name of the event you are firing when a user is put into a variation
  -  **Experiment Id Property** - The property name that stores the experiment tracking key
  -  **Variation Id Property** - The property name that stores the variation the user was assigned
  -  **Variation Id Format** - What format the variation id is stored in.
     1.  Numeric (0 = control, 1 = variation 1, etc.)
     2.  Unique String Keys (e.g. "blue", "random-uuid", etc.)
- Page Views
  -  **Page Views Event** - the name of the event you are firing for every page view on your site
  -  **URL Path Property** - in the event, the property name that stores the URL path for the pageview 
  -  **User Agent Property** - In the event, the property name that stores the user agent for the pageview

## Connection Info

Connection info is encrypted twice - once within the app and again by the database when persisting to disk.

Growth Book only runs `SELECT` queries (or the equivalent for non-SQL data sources).  We still always recommend creating read-only users with as few permissions as possible.

If you are using Growth Book Cloud (https://app.growthbook.io), make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40` if applicable.

### AWS Athena

Unlike other database engines with their own user management system, Athena uses IAM for authentication.

We recommend creating a new IAM user with readonly permissions for Growth Book.  The managed [Quick Sight Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy.html) is a good starting point.

For the S3 results url, we recommend naming your bucket with the prefix `aws-athena-query-results-`

### BigQuery

You must first create a Service Account in Google with the proper permissions. To connect Growth Book, we just need the JSON key file for that account.
It should contain the project_id, client_email, and private_key.

### Mixpanel

You must first create a Service Account in Mixpanel under your [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project#serviceaccounts).

To add the datasource in Growth Book, you will need:
1.  The service account username
2.  The service account secret
3.  Your project id (found on the Project Settings Overview page)

### Google Analytics

Because of Google Analytics tracking limitations, a user can only be in a single experiment at a time. We highly recommend using a more full-featured data source for serious A/B testing.

We require 3 things to query the Google Analytics API:
1.  OAuth Authorization
2.  View ID (found in Admin -> View Settings)
3.  Custom Dimension Index

When tracking experiment views, the custom dimension value must be formatted as `experiment-key:variation-index`.  For example: `my-test:0` for the control and `my-test:1` for the 1st variation.
