Growth Book consists of a NextJS front-end, an ExpressJS API, and a Python stats engine.  Everything is bundled together in a single [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/growthbook/growthbook).

In addition to the app itself, you will also need a MongoDB instance to store login credentials, cached experiment results, and metadata.

You can use **docker-compose** to get started quickly:

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  mongo:
    image: "mongo:latest"
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  growthbook:
    image: "growthbook/growthbook:latest"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "3100:3100"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:password@mongo:27017/
```

Then, just run `docker-compose up -d` to start everything and view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Configuration

The Growth Book App is configured via environment variables.  Below are all of the configuration options:

- **NODE_ENV** - Set to "production" to turn on additional optimizations and API request logging
- **JWT_SECRET** - Auth signing key (use a long random string)
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY** - Data source credential encryption key (use a long random string)
- **APP_ORIGIN** - Used for CORS (default set to http://localhost:3000)
- **MONGODB_URI** - The MongoDB connection string
- **DISABLE_TELEMETRY** - We collect anonymous telemetry data to help us improve Growth Book. Set to "true" to disable.
- **API_HOST** - (default set to http://localhost:3100)
- Email SMTP Settings:
  - **EMAIL_ENABLED** ("true" or "false")
  - **EMAIL_HOST**
  - **EMAIL_PORT**
  - **EMAIL_HOST_USER**
  - **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**
  - **EMAIL_USE_TLS** ("true" or "false")
- Google OAuth Settings (only if using Google Analytics as a data source)
  - **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID**
  - **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET**

### Changing the Ports

The Docker image exposes 2 ports: `3000` for the front-end and `3100` for the API.

If you need to change these, you can use Docker port mappings.  You'll also need to set the environment variables **API_HOST** and **APP_ORIGIN** to include your new ports.

Here's an example of switching to ports `4000` and `4100` in `docker-compose.yml`:


```yml
  growthbook:
    image: "growthbook/growthbook:latest"
    ports:
      - "4000:3000"
      - "4100:3100"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:4000
      - API_HOST=http://localhost:4100
      ...
```

Now your app would be available on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Volumes

Images uploaded in the Growth Book app are stored in `/usr/local/src/app/packages/back-end/uploads`.  We recommend mounting a volume there so images can be persisted.

Also, if you are running MongoDB through Docker, you will need to mount a volume to `/data/db` to persist data between container restarts.  In production, we highly suggest just using a hosted solution like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) instead.

### Commands

These are the possible commands you can use:

-  `["yarn", "start"]` - default, start both front-end and back-end in parallel
-  `["yarn", "workspace", "front-end", "run"]` - run only the front-end
-  `["yarn", "workspace", "back-end", "run"]` - run only the back-end

## Docker Tags

Builds are published automatically from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) main branch.

The most recent commit is tagged with `latest`. GitHub Releases are also tagged (e.g. `0.2.1`).

If you need to reference the image for a specific git commit for any reason, you can use the git shorthash tag (e.g. `git-41278e9`).

### Updating to Latest

If you are using docker-compose, you can update with:

```bash
docker-compose pull growthbook
docker-compose stop growthbook
docker-compose up -d --no-deps growthbook
```

## Using the App

The Growth Book App consists of [Data Sources](/app/datasources), [Metrics](/app/metrics), and [Experiments](/app/experiments). Read on to learn more about these and how to use them.
