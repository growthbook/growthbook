# User Guide

The following sections will walk you through the various parts of the GrowthBook app.

- Connect to your [Data Sources](/app/datasources) so we can pull experiment results automatically.
- Define your [Metrics](/app/metrics) that you can use as goals and guardrails for experiments.
- Create an [Experiment](/app/experiments) and view results.
- Enable our [Visual Editor](/app/visual) so non-technical teammates can launch experiments without writing code.
- Integrate with our [API](/app/api) or [Webhooks](/app/webhooks) for a more seamless experience.
