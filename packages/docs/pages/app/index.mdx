# Growth Book App

The Growth Book App is a web application to manage your A/B tests and analyze results.

You can host the app yourself with the [Open Source project](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook).  Or, we can host it for you at https://app.growthbook.io.

## Quick Start

Get started using the Growth Book experimentation platform 
in just a few minutes.

1.  Connect to your Data Source
2.  Add a metric
3.  Create an Experiment
4.  View Results

### Connect to your Data Source

Unlike other A/B testing platforms like Optimizely or Split.io, you don't send impressions and metrics to Growth Book.

Instead, you write them to your existing analytics tool or data warehouse and Growth Book queries those data sources to pull results. This has a few huge benefits:

*  The Growth Book App is not in the critical rendering path of your application.  
*  Your data stays with you which simplifies security and data governance issues.  
*  A/B test results can use the exact same data and metrics as your dashboards and other reports.

For this quick start, we're going to skip this step and just manually enter data instead of querying it.

View the [data source documentation](/app/datasources) to learn more about data sources.

### Add a Metric

Metrics are what you are trying to change with experimentation.
For example, newsletter signups, revenue, or unsubscribe rate.

For this example, we are going to imagine optimizing a pricing page for 
a SaaS product.  The metrics we'll use are `Viewed Checkout` and `Subscribed`.

To start, click on Metrics in the site menu.

1.  Click the green "`+ Add Metric`" button
2.  For metric name, enter "`Viewed Checkout`"
3.  Set the data source to "`Manual`"
4.  Keep the conversion type set to "`Binomial`" since this metric only has 2 possible values - yes or no
5.  Leave everything else as the default and click the Save button

Repeat the above to add a 2nd metric "`Subscribed`", which is also binomial.

View the [metrics documentation](/app/metrics) to learn more about metrics.


## Create an Experiment

Experiments are the actual A/B tests you run.  In the site menu, click on Experiments and then the New Experiment button in the top right.

Fill out the following info and click the Create button.

-  **Name**: Pricing Display
-  **Hypothesis**: Showing the per-month price instead will reduce sticker shock and increase conversions.
-  **Metrics**: *select both metrics created earlier*
-  **Control Name**: Annual
-  **Variation 1 Name**: Monthly

You'll now have an experiment draft.  Click the "Start" button next to the experiment title.

Experiments go through 1 or more *phases*.  For this example, we're just going to have a single *main* phase with 
100% of traffic split evenly between the variations.

Accept the default values in the form and click "Start".

At this point, you would implement the changes on your site using one of our Client Libraries and collect data for a while.  
For this quick start, we'll just fast forward and assume we already did that.

View the [experiments documentation](/app/experiments) to learn more about experiments.

## View Results

Start by clicking the new Results tab on the experiment page.

Click the "Update Data" button. Since we haven't set up a data source yet, we'll need to manually enter data:

| Metric           | Annual | Monthly |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| Users            | 5024   | 5067    |
| Viewed Checkout  | 1032   | 1156    |
| Subscribed       | 356    | 361     |

Click Submit to save the data and you should see the statistical analysis.

Our change got more people to start checking out, but did 
not result in any increase in subscriptions.  Let's stop the experiment and add our notes:

Click the "Stop Experiment" button and fill in the following info:

-  **Conclusion**: Inconclusive
-  **Addition Analysis**: Increased checkouts, but not subscriptions. Users may have viewed this as a bait and switch.

Click the "Stop" button to end the experiment and save your comments.
