# Features

Features enable you to change your app's behavior from within the
GrowthBook UI. For example, turn on/off a sales banner or change the
title of your pricing page.

You can set a global value for everyone, use advanced targeting to
assign values to users, and run experiments to see which value is
better.

## Environments

GrowthBook comes with two environments - **dev** and **production**, and each one has their own unique API endpoint for getting a list of features.

Features can be enabled and disabled on a per-environment basis.

When a feature is disabled in an environment, it will always evaluate to `null` and ignore any other targeting or override rules.

**Note:** It's possible for a feature to be enabled for an environment and still be considered "off". This happens when its value is set to `false`, `null`, `0`, or an empty string.

## Feature Keys

Every feature is defined by a unique **key**. This is what the engineering team will reference in their code when they check the value of a feature. Feature keys cannot be changed after they are created, so take care when choosing one.

Feature keys must be all lowercase and include only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

Some examples of good feature keys:

- `onboarding-checklist` - ON/OFF flag for a feature
- `checkout-button-color` - The color of the checkout button
- `results-per-page` - Number of search results to show per page

## Feature Types

Features can be a simple ON/OFF flag or a more complex data type (strings, numbers or JSON).

ON/OFF flags can support any of the following use cases:

- Decouple code deploys and releases
- Kill switch for production
- Gradual rollout of features
- Complex targeting and segmentation of features
- Validating feature releases with A/B tests

More complex data types enable you to have more than 2 possible states. For example, if you have a checkout button that is currently blue, you could use an ON/OFF flag called `new-button-color` that sets it to red when ON, but this is pretty limiting since you can't easily try other colors in the future. Instead, if you use a flag `button-color` and make it a string data type, you can easily set the value to 'blue', 'red', 'green', or any other color without changing your code.

## Targeting Attributes

Feature values can be targeted to specific users or groups of users. In order for this to work, you must pass targeting attributes into the GrowthBook SDK and also list them in the GrowthBook App.

This is an example of specifying the targeting attributes in the SDK:

```ts
growthbook.setAttributes({
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  country: user.country,
  url: window.location.href,
  userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
  admin: user.isAdmin,
  age: user.age,
});
```

You can update the attributes in the GrowthBook App under **Settings** > **Attributes**:

![List of targeting attributes](/images/edit-targeting-attributes.png)

**Note**: The actual values of the targeting attributes (e.g. the user ids, emails, etc.) are never sent to GrowthBook. They are only stored in memory locally within the SDK. This architecture eliminates huge potential security holes and keeps your user's PII safe and secure.

Each attribute has 3 parts:

- The **attribute name** itself. This is how the attribute will be referenced in the SDK.
- The **data type** of the attribute
  - String - freeform text
  - Number - Floats or integers
  - Boolean - true or false
  - Array of strings - useful for things like "tags"
  - Array of numbers - useful anytime you have multiple numeric values
  - Enum - When there are only a small list of pre-defined values it could take
- Whether or not it's an **identifier**. Identifiers are attributes which uniquely identify something - typically either a person, account, company, or device.

## Override Rules

Every feature has a default value that is served to all users. The real power comes when you define **override rules** that let you run experiments and/or change the value based on targeting attributes.

Override rules are defined separately for each environment (dev and production). This way you can, for example, test an experiment rule in dev first before deploying it to production.

The first matching rule for a user will be applied, so order matters. If there are no matching rules, the default value will be used.

### Conditions

Rules can specify conditions to limit which users the rule applies to. These conditions are evaluated against the targeting attributes in the SDK.

There is an easy-to-use UI for simple conditions:

![Rule conditions UI](/images/rule-conditions.png)

In advanced mode, you can specify conditions using the MongoDB query syntax. This enables you to have nested logic, advanced array operators and more. Here's an example:

```js
// Either the user's name starts with "john"
// OR they are over 65 and have a kid who's a doctor
{
  "$or": [
    {
      "name": { "$regex": "^john" }
    },
    {
      "age": { "$gt": 65 },
      "kids": {
        "$elemMatch": {
          "profession": "doctor"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: We use the MongoDB query syntax because it is easy to read and write and is well documented. The conditions are never actually executed against a database. Instead, our SDKs include a light-weight interpreter for this syntax that runs entirely locally.

### Forced Value

The simplest type of override rule is a "Forced Value" rule. This forces everyone who matches the targeting condition to get a specific value. For example, you could have a feature default to OFF and use force rules to turn it ON for a specific list of countries.

### Percentage Rollout

Percentage Rollout rules let you gradually release a feature value to a random sample of your users.

Rollouts are most useful when you want to make sure a new feature doesn't break your app or site. You start by releasing to maybe 10% of users. Then after a while if your metrics look ok, you increase to 30% and so on.

For rollout rules, you choose a user attribute to use for the random sample. Users with the same attribute value will be treated the same (either included or not included in the rollout). For example, if you choose a "company" attribute, then multiple employees in the same company will get the same experience.

### Experiments

The last type of rule is an Experiment. This randomly splits users into buckets, assigns them different values, and tracks that assignment in your data warehouse or analytics tool.

Experiments are most useful when you aren't sure which value to assign yet.

Here's what an Experiment rule looks like in the GrowthBook UI:

![Experiment rule](/images/experiment-rule.png)

In the vast majority of cases, you want to split traffic based on either a logged-in user id or some sort of anonymous identifier like a device id or session cookie. As long as the user has the same value for this attribute, they will always get assigned the same variation. In rare cases, you may want to use an attribute such as company or account instead, which ensures all users in a company will see the same thing.

If the total variation percents add up to less than 100%, the remaining users will skip the rule and fall through to the next matching one (or the default value) instead.

You can analyze the result of an Experiment the same way you would any experiment in GrowthBook.

## Integration Options

There are few ways to integrate GrowthBook features into your application.

At a high level, the features you create in the GrowthBook UI can be rendered as a single JSON feature definitions file for each environment (dev and production). The contents of this JSON file must be passed into the SDK. Any feature flags evaluated before the JSON file loads will have a value of `null`, so it's important to load the features quickly.

There is a public GrowthBook [API endpoint](/app/api) for the feature definitions JSON:

- https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/{MY_API_KEY} (GrowthBook Cloud)
- http://localhost:3100/api/features/{MY_API_KEY} (Self-hosted)

The API includes a cache header with a 30-second TTL (plus stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error headers).

**Note:** There are separate API keys for dev and production. Make sure you are using the right one for your environment.

### Load directly (client-side rendering)

You can use `window.fetch` (or similar) to fetch from the API when your app first loads on the client:

```js
fetch(`https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/${MY_API_KEY}`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((json) => {
    growthbook.setFeatures(json.features);
  });
```

For self-hosted deployments, we highly recommend using a CDN like Fastly or CloudFlare. The GrowthBook API alone is not meant to serve large amounts of production traffic. The API returns standard cache headers (max-age, stale-while-revalidate, and stale-if-error) so no special CDN configuration is required most of the time.

The downside of this approach is that you're adding a network request into your critical rendering path. If the HTTP request is slow (or if the API crashes) for whatever reason, your user experience will suffer.

### Cache in memory (server-side rendering)

One option for server-side integration is to fetch the features once when your application starts up, cache the JSON in memory in the server, and re-use the cached copy for subsequent requests.

If your servers are long-lived, you may want to build in some logic to refetch the JSON periodically to pick up any new changes.

The benefit of this approach is the simplicity (no additional dependencies) and the speed (once loaded, feature evaluations are almost instant). The downside is that this may lead to longer cold start times and you need to handle the refresh logic yourself.

### Cache in a distributed store (server-side rendering)

Another option for server-side rendering is to use a distributed cache store like Redis or Memcached, or even a full database like Postgres.

The main difference between this and the in-memory approach is in how you load and keep the feature definitions up-to-date. With a distributed system, you can have an external process like a cron job or [webhook](/app/webhooks) listener update the cache. This keeps your application logic simple and eliminates the cold start problem.

### Load at build-time (static generation)

Another approach is to fetch the feature definitions JSON once at build time and bundle them with your app.

This is the fastest approach since it avoids all 3rd party requests entirely. Once your app is built, loading features for each request is almost instant.

The downside is that in order to update feature defintiions, you need to create a new build of your app. If you need to turn off a feature quickly (in case of a bug) this may be a problem.
