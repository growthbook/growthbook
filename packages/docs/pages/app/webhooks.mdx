# Webhooks

Webhooks are one way to keep cached feature definitions up-to-date on your servers.

With **Webhooks**, GrowthBook pushes feature definitions to your servers as soon as they change.

The other way is with the [API](/app/api), where your servers pull feature definitions from GrowthBook in a cronjob (or similar).

## Adding a Webhook Endpoint

When logged into GrowthBook as an admin, navigate to **Settings -> Webhooks**.

There you can add a webhook endpoint.

This page is also where you can view the shared secret used to verify requests (see below) and see the status of your webhook and any errors.

## Payload

Webhooks will do a `POST` to the endpoint you provide. The body is a JSON object containing feature definitions in the same format as the API returns.

**Note:** Only features enabled in production are sent via webhooks. The only way to retrieve dev features is via the [API](/app/api).

Here's an example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1625098156,
  "features": {
    "feature1": {
      "defaultValue": true
    }
  }
}
```

The `features` field has one entry per feature definition. Features can have the following properties:

- **defaultValue**
- **rules[]** - Array of feature rules
  - **condition** - A JSON condition using MongoDB query syntax
  - **force** - Force a specific value, takes precedence over all other rules besides `condition`
  - **variations[]** - Run an experiment and randomly assign one of the specified variations
  - **key** - When running an experiment, this is the experiment key that will be passed to the tracking callback function
  - **weights[]** - Determines how traffic is split between variations in an experiment
  - **coverage** - Specifies what sampling rate (0 to 1) to use for including users in an experiment. A rate of `1` means everyone is included. A rate of `0` means no one is.

## VPCs and Firewalls

If your webhook endpoint is behind a firewall and you are using GrowthBook Cloud, make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40`.

## Verify Signatures

Webhook payloads are signed with a shared secret so you can verify they actually came from GrowthBook. The signature is passed in a `X-GrowthBook-Signature` header.

Here is example code in NodeJS for verifying the signature. Other languages should be similar:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

// Retrieve from GrowthBook settings
const GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "abc123";

const app = express();

app.post(
  "/webhook",
  bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;
    const sig = req.get("X-GrowthBook-Signature");

    const computed = crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
      .update(req.body)
      .digest("hex");

    if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(computed), Buffer.from(sig))) {
      throw new Error("Signatures do not match!");
    }

    const { features } = JSON.parse(payload);
    // TODO: Store in a cache or database

    // Make sure to respond with a 200 status code
    res.status(200).send("");
  }
);
```

## Errors and Retries

If your endpoint returns any HTTP status besides `200`, the webhook will be considered failed.

Failed webhooks are tried a total of 3 times using an exponential back-off between attempts.

You can view the status of your webhooks in the GrowthBook app under **Settings -> Webhooks**.
