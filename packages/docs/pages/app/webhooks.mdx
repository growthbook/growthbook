# Webhooks

Webhooks are one way to keep cached experiment configuration up-to-date on your servers.

With the [API](/app/api), your servers pull experiment overrides from GrowthBook in a cronjob (or similar).

With **Webhooks**, GrowthBook pushes experiment overrides to your servers as soon as they change.

## Adding a Webhook Endpoint

When logged into GrowthBook as an admin, navigate to **Settings -> Webhooks**.

There you can add a webhook endpoint.

This page is also where you can view the shared secret used to verify requests (see below) and see the status of your webhook and any errors.

## Payload

Webhooks will do a `POST` to the endpoint you provide. The body is a JSON object containing experiment overrides in the same format as the API returns.

Here's an example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1625098156,
  "overrides": {
    "experiment-key": {
      "status": "running",
      "weights": [0.5, 0.5],
      "coverage": 1,
      "groups": ["beta"],
      "url": "^/post/[0-9]+$"
    },
    "another-experiment": {
      "status": "stopped",
      "force": 2
    }
  }
}
```

The `overrides` field has one entry per experiment with overrides that should take precedence over hard-coded values in your code.

- **status** - Either "draft", "running", or "stopped". Stopped experiments are only included in the response if a non-control variation won.
- **weights** - How traffic should be weighted between variations. Will add up to 1.
- **coverage** - A float from 0 to 1 (inclusive) which specifies what percent of users to include in the experiment.
- **groups** - An array of user groups who are eligible for the experiment
- **url** - A regex for which URLs the experiment should run on
- **force** - Force all users to see the specified variation index (`0` = control, `1` = first variation, etc.).

## VPCs and Firewalls

If your webhook endpoint is behind a firewall and you are using GrowthBook Cloud, make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40`.

## Verify Signatures

Webhook payloads are signed with a shared secret so you can verify they actually came from GrowthBook. The signature is passed in a `X-GrowthBook-Signature` header.

Here is example code in NodeJS for verifying the signature. Other languages should be similar:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

// Retrieve from GrowthBook settings
const GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "abc123";

const app = express();

app.post("/webhook", bodyParser.raw(), (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  const sig = req.get("X-GrowthBook-Signature");

  const computed = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(req.body)
    .digest("hex");

  if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(computed), Buffer.from(sig))) {
    throw new Error("Signatures do not match!");
  }

  const { overrides } = JSON.parse(payload);
  // TODO: Store in a cache or database

  // Make sure to respond with a 200 status code
  res.status(200).send("");
});
```

## Errors and Retries

If your endpoint returns any HTTP status besides `200`, the webhook will be considered failed.

Failed webhooks are tried a total of 3 times using an exponential back-off between attempts.

You can view the status of your webhooks in the GrowthBook app under **Settings -> Webhooks**.
