# API

The API is one way to keep cached features up-to-date on your servers.

With the **API**, your servers pull feature definitions from GrowthBook in a cronjob (or similar).

With [Webhooks](/app/webhooks), GrowthBook calls out to your servers as soon as features change in GrowthBook.

## Environments and API Keys

When you first start setting up features in GrowthBook, we create a "production" environment for you with an API key.

You can add new environments by going to **Settings -> Environments**.

## Feature Definitions Endpoint

The primary API endpoint is for fetching feature definitions.

For **self-hosted** deployments, the endpoint is at [http://localhost:3100/api/features/{myKey}](http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}) (note: port 3000 is the default front-end app, port 3100 is the default for the API)

For **GrowthBook Cloud**, the endpoint is on our global CDN: https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/{myKey}

Here is an example API response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "features": {
    "feature-key": {
      "defaultValue": true
    },
    "another-feature": {
      "defaultValue": "blue",
      "rules": [
        {
          "condition": {
            "browser": "firefox"
          },
          "force": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field mirrors the HTTP status. The `features` field has feature definitions indexed by the feature key.

Each feature definition has a default value and optional rules that override the value based on targeting conditions. Rules can also be experiments or rollouts where values are randomly assigned to users.

### Project-scoping

If you've set up multiple projects within GrowthBook, you can optionally add a querystring to this endpoint to only include features in a specific project. By default, features from all projects are returned.

To do this, add the querystring `?project={projectId}`. You can find the id for your project under Settings > Projects (will start with `prj_`).

For example:

```
/api/features/key_dev_abc123?project=prj_456def
```
