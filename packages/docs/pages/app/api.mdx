# API

The API is one way to keep cached experiment configuration up-to-date on your servers.

With the **API**, your servers pull experiment overrides from Growth Book in a cronjob (or similar).

With [Webhooks](/app/webhooks), Growth Book pushes experiment overrides to your servers as soon as they change.

## Creating an API Key

When logged into Growth Book as an admin, navigate to **Settings -> API Keys**.

There you can generate an API key and give it an optional description.

## Experiment Overrides Endpoint

As of right now, there is only a single public API endpoint that returns experiment configuration info.

For **self-hosted** deployments, the endpoint is at [http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}](http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}) (note: port 3000 is the default front-end app, port 3100 is the API)

For **Growth Book Cloud**, the endpoint is on our global CDN: https://cdn.growthbook.io/config/{myKey}

Here is an example API response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "overrides": {
    "experiment-key": {
      "status": "running",
      "weights": [0.5, 0.5],
      "coverage": 1,
      "groups": ["beta"],
      "url": "^/post/[0-9]+$"
    },
    "another-experiment": {
      "status": "stopped",
      "force": 2
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field just mirrors the HTTP status code.

The `overrides` field has one entry per experiment with overrides that should take precedence over hard-coded values in your code.

- **status** - Either "draft", "running", or "stopped". Stopped experiments are only included in the response if a non-control variation won.
- **weights** - How traffic should be weighted between variations. Will add up to 1.
- **coverage** - A float from 0 to 1 (inclusive) which specifies what percent of users to include in the experiment.
- **groups** - An array of user groups who are eligible for the experiment
- **url** - A regex for which URLs the experiment should run on
- **force** - Force all users to see the specified variation index (`0` = control, `1` = first variation, etc.).
