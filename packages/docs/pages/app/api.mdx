# API

The API is one way to keep cached experiment overrides and features up-to-date on your servers.

With the **API**, your servers pull configs from GrowthBook in a cronjob (or similar).

With [Webhooks](/app/webhooks), GrowthBook pushes configs to your servers as soon as they change.

## Creating an API Key

When logged into GrowthBook as an admin, navigate to **Settings -> API Keys**.

There you can generate an API key and give it an optional description.

There are two API endpoints. One for getting experiment overrides, and another for getting feature definitions.

## Experiment Overrides Endpoint

For **self-hosted** deployments, the endpoint is at [http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}](http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}) (note: port 3000 is the default front-end app, port 3100 is the default for the API)

For **GrowthBook Cloud**, the endpoint is on our global CDN: https://cdn.growthbook.io/config/{myKey}

Here is an example API response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "overrides": {
    "experiment-key": {
      "status": "running",
      "weights": [0.5, 0.5],
      "coverage": 1,
      "groups": ["beta"],
      "url": "^/post/[0-9]+$"
    },
    "another-experiment": {
      "status": "stopped",
      "force": 2
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field just mirrors the HTTP status code.

The `overrides` field has one entry per experiment with overrides that should take precedence over hard-coded values in your code.

- **status** - Either "draft", "running", or "stopped". Stopped experiments are only included in the response if a non-control variation won.
- **weights** - How traffic should be weighted between variations. Will add up to 1.
- **coverage** - A float from 0 to 1 (inclusive) which specifies what percent of users to include in the experiment.
- **groups** - An array of user groups who are eligible for the experiment
- **url** - A regex for which URLs the experiment should run on
- **force** - Force all users to see the specified variation index (`0` = control, `1` = first variation, etc.).

## Feature Definitions Endpoint

For **self-hosted** deployments, the endpoint is at [http://localhost:3100/api/features/{myKey}](http://localhost:3100/config/{myKey}) (note: port 3000 is the default front-end app, port 3100 is the default for the API)

For **GrowthBook Cloud**, the endpoint is on our global CDN: https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/{myKey}

Here is an example API response:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "features": {
    "feature-key": {
      "defaultValue": true
    },
    "another-feature": {
      "defaultValue": "blue",
      "rules": [
        {
          "condition": {
            "browser": "firefox"
          },
          "force": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `status` field mirrors the HTTP status. The `features` field has feature definitions indexed by the feature key.

Each feature definition has a default value and optional rules that override the value based on targeting conditions. Rules can also be experiments where values are randomly assigned to users.

## Official SDKs

We offer official SDKs that work with these data structures in a few popular languages with more coming soon.

- [Javascript/Typescript](/lib/js) (experiments and features)
- [React](/lib/react) (experiments and features)
- [Go](/lib/go) (experiments and features)
- [Kotlin (Android)](/lib/kotlin) (experiments and features)
- [PHP](/lib/php) (experiments only)
- [Ruby](/lib/ruby) (experiments only)
- [Python](/lib/python) (experiments only)
- [Build your own](/lib/build-your-own) (experiments only)
