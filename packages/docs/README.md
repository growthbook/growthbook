## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes, and especially to the Docs. To start working on the docs, you can either edit the markdown files directly in GitHub, or clone the repo and run the docs locally.
To get the docs running locally, you can follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Docs are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and are written in markdown. The docs are located in the `packages/docs/docs` directory.

If you have the docs running locally, you can run `yarn workspace docs dev` to start the docs server. The docs will be available at http://localhost:3200.
