# API

GrowthBook's API has both public endpoints plus an authenticated REST API <Pill>beta</Pill>.

## Public Endpoints

Currently, GrowthBook has a single public endpoint, the **SDK Endpoint**. This is a unique URL that returns your feature definitions, which can be passed into any of the GrowthBook SDKs - front-end, server-side, or mobile. [View All SDKs](/lib)

Using this endpoint is one way to get your feature definitions. The other way is via [Webhooks](/app/webhooks), where we send the same payload to you automatically whenever someone updates a feature in GrowthBook.

### Environments

SDK Endpoints are scoped to a single environment (e.g. `dev` or `production`).

When you first create a GrowthBook account, we add a default "production" environment for you with a single SDK Endpoint. You can add new environments and SDK Endpoints by going to **Features -> Environments**.

### The SDK Endpoint

In **GrowthBook Cloud**, the SDK endpoint is served from our global CDN: `https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/...`. If you are self-hosting, you'll want to set up either a CDN or cache layer yourself in front of the GrowthBook API for scalability and speed.

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  features: {
    [key: string]: FeatureDefinition
  }
}

interface FeatureDefinition {
  defaultValue: any;
  rules?: FeatureDefinitionRule[];
}

interface FeatureDefinitionRule {
  force?: any;
  weights?: number[];
  variations?: any[];
  hashAttribute?: string;
  namespace?: [string, number, number];
  key?: string;
  coverage?: number;
  condition?: any;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "features": {
    "feature-key": {
      "defaultValue": true
    },
    "another-feature": {
      "defaultValue": "blue",
      "rules": [
        {
          "condition": {
            "browser": "firefox"
          },
          "force": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Project-scoping

If you've set up multiple projects within GrowthBook, you can optionally add a querystring to the SDK endpoint to only include features in a specific project. By default, features from all projects are returned.

To do this, add the querystring `?project={projectId}`. You can find the id for your project under Settings > Projects (will start with `prj_`).

For example:

```
/api/features/dev_abc123?project=prj_456def
```

#### Encryption

If you've enabled encryption for your SDK endpoint, the response format changes:

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEncryptedEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  encryptedFeatures: string;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "encryptedFeatures": "abcdef123456GHIJKL0987654321..."
}
```

</details>

You will need to decrypt the features first before passing into the SDK. You can find your encryption key on the **Features -> Environments** page in GrowthBook.

Here's an example in JavaScript using the SubtleCrypto API, which is available in all modern web browsers:

<details>
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Decryption Code Example</summary>

```js
async function decrypt(encryptedText) {
  const GB_ENCRYPTION_KEY = "MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY"; // <-- Set your encryption key here
  const base64ToBuf = (b) => Uint8Array.from(atob(b), (c) => c.charCodeAt(0));
  const key = await window.crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw", base64ToBuf(GB_ENCRYPTION_KEY),
    { name: "AES-CBC", length: 128 }, true, ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
  );
  const [iv, cipherText] = encryptedText.split(".");
  const plainTextBuffer = await window.crypto.subtle
    .decrypt({name: "AES-CBC", iv: base64ToBuf(iv)}, key, base64ToBuf(cipherText));
  return new TextDecoder().decode(plainTextBuffer);
}

// Decrypting gives you a JSON-encoded string
const featuresStr = await decrypt(encryptedFeatures);

// Turn it into a JSON object
const features = JSON.parse(featuresStr);
```

</details>

## Authenticated REST API <Pill>beta</Pill>

In addition to the public API endpoints, GrowthBook also offers a full REST API for interacting with the GrowthBook application. This is currently in **beta** as we add more authenticated API routes and features.

All request and response bodies are JSON-encoded.

The API base URL for GrowthBook Cloud is `https://api.growthbook.io`. For self-hosted deployments, it is the same as your API_HOST environment variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3100`). The rest of these docs will assume you are using GrowthBook Cloud.

### Authentication

We support both the HTTP Basic and Bearer authentication schemes for convenience.

You first need to generate a new Secret Key in GrowthBook by going to `Settings -> API Keys`.

If using HTTP Basic auth, pass the Secret Key as the username and leave the password blank:

```bash
curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456:
# The ":" at the end stops curl from asking for a password
```

If using Bearer auth, pass the Secret Key as the token:

```bash
curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_abc123DEF456"
```

### Errors

The API may return the following error status codes:

- **400** - Bad Request - Often due to a missing required parameter
- **401** - Unauthorized - No valid API key provided
- **402** - Request Failed - The parameters are valid, but the request failed
- **403** - Forbidden - Provided API key does not have the required access
- **404** - Not Found - Unknown API route or requested resource
- **429** - Too Many Requests - You exceeded the rate limit of 60 requests per minute. Try again later.
- **5XX** - Server Error - Something went wrong on GrowthBook's end (these are rare)

The response body will be a JSON object with the following properties:

- **message** - Information about the error

### Pagination

All list methods are paginated and support the querystring parameters:

- `limit` - number to return, between 1 and 100, default `10`
- `offset` - how many to skip, default `0`

For example:

```bash
curl -G https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1/features \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456:
  -d limit=5
  -d offset=10
# Return features 11-15
```

And the response will contain the fields:

- `limit` - The limit used for the current request
- `offset` - The offset used for the current request
- `count` - Number returned in the response
- `total` - Total number of items
- `hasMore` - `true` if there is another page, `false` if there are no more items
- `nextOffset` - Offset to fetch the next page, or `null` if there are no more results

### Features

#### The Feature Object

This object represents a single feature in your account. Features are complex objects with many nested properties.

#### List Features

`GET /api/v1/features`

This endpoint returns all of the features in your account, sorted by dateCreated in chronological order (oldest first).

```bash
curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1/features \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456:
```

The reponse body contains a list of features and pagination information.

<details className="mb-3">

```ts
interface ListFeaturesResponse {
  features: Feature[];
  // Pagination info
  limit: number;
