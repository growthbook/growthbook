  summary: Get metric usage across experiments
  description: |
    Returns usage information for one or more legacy or fact metrics, showing which experiments use each metric 
    and some usage statistics. Warning: only includes experiments that you have access to! If you do not have admin
    access or read access to experiments across all projects, this endpoint may not return the latest usage data across
    all experiments.
