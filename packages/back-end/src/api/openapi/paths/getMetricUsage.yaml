summary: Get metric usage across experiments
description: |
  Returns usage information for one or more legacy or fact metrics, showing which experiments use each metric
  and some usage statistics. If a metric is part of a metric group, then usage of that metric group counts as
  usage of all metrics in the group. Warning: only includes experiments that you have access to! If you do not have admin
  access or read access to experiments across all projects, this endpoint may not return the latest usage data across
  all experiments.
