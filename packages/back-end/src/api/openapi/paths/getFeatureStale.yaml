                Reason for the feature's stale status. `never-stale` means stale
                detection is permanently disabled for this feature. `no-rules`
                means the feature has no active targeting rules.
                `rules-one-sided` means all rules evaluate to the same variation.
                Null when the feature is not stale and stale detection is active.

                ISO 8601 timestamp of when stale status was last computed by the
                background job. Null if it has never been calculated.

                When true the feature is permanently excluded from stale detection
                regardless of its rules.
