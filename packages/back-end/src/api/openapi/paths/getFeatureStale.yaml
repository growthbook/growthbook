                Reason for the feature's stale or non-stale status.
                `never-stale` when stale detection is disabled.
                Non-stale reasons: `recently-updated`, `active-draft`, `has-dependents`.
                Stale reasons: `no-rules`, `rules-one-sided`, `abandoned-draft`, `toggled-off`.
                Null when non-stale with no single cause (see staleByEnv).

                      Uses the same raw string encoding as `feature.defaultValue`.
                      Only present when the value is deterministic or the environment is toggled off.
