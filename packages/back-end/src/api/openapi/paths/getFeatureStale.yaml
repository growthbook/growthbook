                Reason for the feature's stale or non-stale status.
                Non-stale reasons: `never-stale` (stale detection disabled),
                `recently-updated` (changed within 2 weeks), `active-draft`
                (open draft in progress), `has-dependents` (used by a non-stale
                dependent). Stale reasons: `no-rules` (no active rules in any
                enabled environment), `rules-one-sided` (all rules evaluate to
                one value), `abandoned-draft` (open draft untouched over a
                month). Null when non-stale with no single cause (see staleByEnv).

              type: string
              format: date-time
              nullable: true
              description: >
                ISO 8601 timestamp of when stale status was last computed by the
                background job. Null if it has never been calculated.
            neverStale:
              type: boolean
              description: >
                When true the feature is permanently excluded from stale detection
                regardless of its rules.
