# GrowthBook Back-End

This document is meant for developers who want to contribute to the GrowthBook platform. It covers the following topics:

- Permissions
- Free vs Commercial Features
- Data Models
- Tests

More coming soon!

## Permissions

Users in GrowthBook have roles which grant them permissions to do various actions. Any endpoint which creates, edits, or deletes should check permissions as part of request handler.

Permissions have one of 3 "scopes":

- Environment (e.g. `publishFeatures`)
- Project (e.g. `createIdea`)
- Global (e.g. `manageTeam`)

There is a `req.checkPermissions` function you can use in your request handlers. It will throw an Exception if the current user does not have access.

```ts
// Global-scoped permission
req.checkPermissions("manageTeam");

// Project-scoped permission
req.checkPermissions("createIdea", "my-project");

// Environment-scoped permission
req.checkPermissions("publishFeatures", "my-project", ["dev"]);
```

Typescript will warn you if you use the wrong arguments for a permission (e.g. `req.checkPermissions("publishFeatures")` will be an error since you forgot to pass in project and environments).

For more complex actions that do multiple things, you may need to call `req.checkPermissions` multiple times.

### Adding new permissions

If you need to add new permissions, you'll need to update the `src/util/organization.util.ts` file in a couple places:

- Add your permission to either the `GLOBAL_PERMISSIONS`, `PROJECT_SCOPED_PERMISSIONS`, or `ENV_SCOPED_PERMISSIONS` constant
- In the `getRoles` function, add the permission to all roles that should have access to it

You'll also need to update the front-end `services/UserContext.tsx` and add it to the `DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS` constant.

## Free vs Commercial Features

GrowthBook follows an "Open Core" model, where the majority of the application is free and open source, but there are commercial features added on top that require a paid license.

It's also sometimes necessary to differentiate between self-hosted deployments and GrowthBook Cloud. We try to keep these checks to a minimum in the code to make the platform easier to test and maintain.

There are currently only a few commercial features defined in the code, but more will be added in the future.

There is a helper function to check if a commercial feature is available to the current organization:

```ts
if (orgHasPremiumFeature(req.org, "sso")) {
  // ...
}
```

And an environment variable to check if you are on GrowthBook Cloud:

```ts
if (IS_CLOUD) {
  // ...
}
```

### Adding new commercial features

If you want to add a new commercial feature, you need to edit the `enterprise` package:

- `packages/enterprise/src/license.ts` - Add to the `CommercialFeature` union type and edit the `accountFeatures` map, which defines which plans have access to which features

## Data Models

GrowthBook uses MongoDB and Mongoose. Each database collection has a few corresponding files:

- A Typescript type definition in `types/MODEL_NAME.d.ts`
- A Mongoose schema in `src/models/MODEL_NAME.ts`

### Editing an existing data model

If you want to add/change a field on an existing data model, in addition to the type definition and mongoose schema listed above, you may also have to change the following:

- Controllers in `src/controllers/`
- Service files in `src/services/`
- Front-end pages or components

### Adding a new data model

A good example to copy is `src/models/ProjectModel.ts`. A few things to note:

- The schema and model are NOT exported. The only thing
- All methods which return documents are doing `toJSON()` first and returning plain objects instead of Mongoose objects
- None of the "find" methods take a MongoDB query as input, they take explicit fields instead

All of the above help keep the database-specific logic constrained to the Model file, which is easier to maintain.

In addition to the type definitions and the model file, you also probably want to add API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on your model. This is done with "controller" files.

A good example to copy is `src/controllers/projects.ts`.

Each API endpoint defined there:

1. Checks permissions
2. Gets user inputs
3. Performs validation (if needed)
4. Calls exported Model functions to update the database
5. Returns a response

To make it available from the front-end, you'll need to import your controller and register the request handler functions in `src/app.ts`.

## Tests

We use Jest to write tests on the back-end.

To avoid pulling in Mongo dependencies, all tested code should be in small standalone util files that do not import db models.

## REST API endpoints

We use OpenAPI to document our REST endpoints.

Let's say you want to add a REST endpoint to get a list of projects.

### OpenAPI Spec

First, you would document the endpoint using OpenAPI:

1. Describe the resource (Project) with a JSON schema: `src/api/openapi/schemas/Project.yaml`
   ```yml
   type: object
   required:
     - id
     - name
   properties:
     id:
       type: string
     name:
       type: string
   ```
2. Reference your schema in `src/api/openapi/schemas/_index.yaml`
   ```yml
   Project:
     $ref: "./Project.yaml"
   ```
3. Describe the API endpoint in `src/api/openapi/paths/listProjects.yaml`
   ```yml
   get:
     summary: Get all projects
     tags:
       - projects
     parameters:
       - $ref: "../parameters.yaml#/limit"
       - $ref: "../parameters.yaml#/offset"
     operationId: listProjects
     x-codeSamples:
       - lang: "cURL"
         source: |
           curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1/projects \
             -u secret_abc123DEF456:
     responses:
       "200":
         content:
           application/json:
             schema:
               allOf:
                 - type: object
                   required:
                     - projects
                   properties:
                     projects:
                       type: array
                       items:
                         $ref: "../schemas/Project.yaml"
                 - $ref: "../schemas/PaginationFields.yaml"
   ```
4. Add the endpoint to `src/api/openapi/openapi.yaml` under `paths`
   ```yml
   /projects:
     $ref: "./paths/listProjects.yaml"
   ```
5. In the same `src/api/openapi/openapi.yaml` file, define the `projects` tag:
   ```yml
   - name: projects
     x-displayName: Projects
     description: Projects are used to organize your feature flags and experiments
   ```

We use a generator to automatically create Typescript types, Zod validators, and API documentation for all of our resources and endpoints. Any time you edit the `yaml` files, you will need to re-run this generator.

```bash
yarn generate-api-types
```

### Router and Business Logic

Next, you'll need to create a helper function to convert from our internal DB interface to the API interface:

```ts
// src/models/ProjectModel.ts
import { ApiProject } from "../../types/openapi";
import { ProjectInterface } from "../../types/project";

export function toProjectApiInterface(project: ProjectInterface): ApiProject {
  return {
    id: project.id,
    name: project.name,
  };
}
```

Then, create a route for your endpoint at `src/api/projects/listProjects.ts`:

```ts
import { ListProjectsResponse } from "../../../types/openapi";
import {
  findAllProjects,
  toProjectApiInterface,
} from "../../models/ProjectModel";
import { applyPagination, createApiRequestHandler } from "../../util/handler";
import { listProjectsValidator } from "../../validators/openapi";

export const listProjects = createApiRequestHandler(listProjectsValidator)(
  async (req): Promise<ListProjectsResponse> => {
    const projects = await findAllProjects(req.organization.id);
    const { filtered, returnFields } = applyPagination(
      projects.sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id)),
      req.query
    );
    return {
      projects: filtered.map((project) => toProjectApiInterface(project)),
      ...returnFields,
    };
  }
);
```

Then, create a router at `src/api/projects/projects.router.ts`:

```ts
import { Router } from "express";
import { listProjects } from "./listProjects";

const router = Router();

// Project Endpoints
// Mounted at /api/v1/projects
router.get("/", listProjects);

export default router;
```

Finally, mount your router in `src/api/api.router.ts`:

```ts
import projectsRouter from "./projects/projects.router";
// ...

router.use("/projects", projectsRouter);
```

That's it! Your API endpoint is live and ready and all the documentation will be auto-generated for you.

### Automating with Plop

We have a Plop script to automate many of the above steps for you.

```bash
yarn plop
```

Then, select `api-object` from the list and enter the name of your resource (`project` in this case).

You'll still have to go through all the steps above and make tweaks as needed, but most of the code will be auto-generated for you.

## Sample Data

### Creating sample data

To use the analysis parts of GrowthBook, you need to connect to a data source with experimentation events.

We have a sample data generator script you can use to seed a database with realistic website traffic:

1. Run `yarn workspace back-end generate-dummy-data`. This will create CSV files in `/tmp/csv`
2. Start your local server (e.g. Postgres, MySQL) or ensure your cloud service (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery) is set up
3. Connect to your database instance and run the SQL commands matching your server type in `packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/` to create the tables and upload the generated data

We have SQL scripts set up to work with Postgres, MySQL, and Snowflake, but you could modify the SQL scripts to work with another system.

WARNING: the purchases.csv file contains `'\N'` to represent null values which may need to be handled differently depending on the DB engine you are using. It works with both the provided scripts discussed below.

**Postgres**

For postgres, launch your connection using `psql` and run this script `packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_postgres.sql` to create the tables and upload the csvs.

You can do this from your terminal with the following command, if your local postgres db is running with user `postgres`, database `growthbook_db`,

```bash
psql -U postgres -d growthbook_db -a -f packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_postgres.sql
```

**MySQL**

Once your local MySQL db is running, you have to ensure that your server allows for local infiles. You can do this in your MySQL config file or by connecting to your instance using `mysql` and running `set global local_infile = true;` in the mysql console.

Then, you can run `packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_mysql.sql` from the mysql console or from the terminal like so (using example user `myuser` and example database `growthbook_db`):

```bash
mysql -u myuser -p growthbook_db --local-infile < packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_mysql.sql
```

**Snowflake**

Create a database and a schema in your Snowflake. Then, you can run `packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_snowflake.sql` using the `snowsql` command line client (see their [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html)). For example, you can run the following in your Mac or Linux terminal if you have a database called `growthbook_db`, a schema called `sample`, account name called `account-name`, and you want to use user `myuser` to log in.

```bash
snowsql -d growthbook_db -s sample -a account-name -u myuser -f packages/back-end/test/data-generator/sql_scripts/create_snowflake.sql
```

Note if you're on a windows machine, you will have to modify `create_snowflake.sql` to point to the files different (see the Snowflake docs [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-internal-tutorial-stage-data-files.html).)

**BigQuery**

We don't include a SQL script for BigQuery, but you can easily upload data by running the following kind of command for each csv file from your terminal, if you have set up the `bq` command line tool:

```bash
bq load --project_id=my-teams-project --skip_leading_rows=1 --source_format=CSV --null_marker="\N" sample.orders /tmp/csv/purchases.csv userId:STRING,anonymousId:STRING,sessionId:STRING,browser:STRING,country:STRING,timestamp:TIMESTAMP,qty:INTEGER,amount:INTEGER
```

where `my-teams-project` is your BQ project, you have created the dataset `sample`, and want to load `purchases.csv` in to the `orders` table in that dataset.

### Loading sample data in to Growthbook

Next, you'll need to set up the connection to your DB from within GrowthBook.

1. Under Analysis->Data Sources, add a new data source
2. Select "Custom Event Source"
3. Select your server type (e.g. Postgres, MySQL) and enter your connection info. If you are running with `yarn dev`, you can use `localhost` safely and ignore the warning in the UI about docker.
4. On the data source page, you can add two identifier types: `user_id` and `anonymous_id`
5. Add an Identifier Join table:

```sql
SELECT
  userId as user_id,
  anonymousId as anonymous_id
FROM
  experiment_viewed
```

6. Then, define an assignment query for logged-in users:
   - Identifier type: `user_id`
   - SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     userId as user_id,
     timestamp as timestamp,
     experimentId as experiment_id,
     variationId as variation_id,
     browser,
     country
   FROM
     experiment_viewed
   ```
   - Dimension columns: `browser`, `country`
7. And another assignment query for anonymous visitors:
   - Identifier type: `anonymous_id`
   - SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     anonymousId as anonymous_id,
     timestamp as timestamp,
     experimentId as experiment_id,
     variationId as variation_id,
     browser,
     country
   FROM
     experiment_viewed
   ```
   - Dimension columns: `browser`, `country`
8. Create a metric:
   - Name: `Purchased`
   - Type: `binomial`
   - Identifier Types: Both `user_id` and `anonymous_id`
   - SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT
     userId as user_id,
     anonymousId as anonymous_id,
     timestamp as timestamp
   FROM
     orders
   ```
9. Go to add an experiment. You should see a few that are ready to be imported from the data source.

There are a lot more metrics you can define with the sample data besides just "Purchased". Here are a few ideas:

- Revenue per User
- Average Order Value
- Page Views per User
- Retention Rate
- Session Duration
- Pages per Session
- Sessions with Searches
