  title: GrowthBook REST API
  description: |
    GrowthBook offers a full REST API for interacting with the application.

    Request data can use either JSON or Form data encoding (with proper `Content-Type` headers). All response bodies are JSON-encoded.

    The API base URL for GrowthBook Cloud is `https://api.growthbook.io`. For self-hosted deployments, it is the same as your API_HOST environment variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3100`). The rest of these docs will assume you are using GrowthBook Cloud.

    ## Authentication

    We support both the HTTP Basic and Bearer authentication schemes for convenience.

    You first need to generate a new API Key in GrowthBook. Different keys have different permissions:

    - **Personal Access Tokens**: These are sensitive and provide the same level of access as the user has to an organization. These can be created by going to `Personal Access Tokens` under the your user menu.
    - **Secret Keys**: These are sensitive and provide the level of access for the role, which currently is either `admin` or `readonly`. Only Admins with the `manageApiKeys` permission can manage Secret Keys on behalf of an organization. These can be created by going to `Settings -> API Keys`

    If using HTTP Basic auth, pass the Secret Key as the username and leave the password blank:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
      -u secret_abc123DEF456:
    # The ":" at the end stops curl from asking for a password
    ```

    If using Bearer auth, pass the Secret Key as the token:

    ```bash
    curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_abc123DEF456"
    ```

    ## Errors

    The API may return the following error status codes:

    - **400** - Bad Request - Often due to a missing required parameter
    - **401** - Unauthorized - No valid API key provided
    - **402** - Request Failed - The parameters are valid, but the request failed
    - **403** - Forbidden - Provided API key does not have the required access
    - **404** - Not Found - Unknown API route or requested resource
    - **429** - Too Many Requests - You exceeded the rate limit of 60 requests per minute. Try again later.
    - **5XX** - Server Error - Something went wrong on GrowthBook's end (these are rare)

    The response body will be a JSON object with the following properties:

    - **message** - Information about the error
