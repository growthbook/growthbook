# Changelog

## **1.0.0** - May 1, 2024

- New `init` and `initSync` functions as a replacement for `loadFeatures`.
- Support payload import/export via `init({ payload })`, `setPayload`, `getPayload`, and `getDecryptedPayload`. Makes it easier to share data between front-end, back-end, and other services.
- Ability to block or control experiments by various context properties
  - `blockedChangeIds` targets individual experiments
  - `disableVisualExperiments` prevents visual experiments from running
  - `disableJsInjection` blocks any visual experiments which write <script\> code
  - `disableUrlRedirectExperiments` prevents redirect experiments from running
  - `disableCrossOriginUrlRedirectExperiments` blocks redirects if the origin changes
  - `disableExperimentsOnLoad` prevents AutoExperiments from running automatically; `triggerAutoExperiments` manually triggers them.
- Provide a custom DOM mutation method by setting context `applyDomChangesCallback`. Useful for server-side rendering visual experiments.
- Fix bug when passing in `stickyBucketAssignmentDocs` to the GrowthBook constructor
- New `jsInjectionNonce` setting to add a nonce onto any injected <script\> tags. This provides a safer alternative to allowing `unsafe-inline` in your Content Security Policy.
- Get a list of triggered experiments by their `changeId` (a new, more-specific AutoExperiment identifier) via `getCompletedChangeIds`.
- Disable in-memory cache via `configureCache({ disableCache: true })` or the new GrowthBook constructor option `disableCache`.
- Easier streaming customization via `init({ streaming: true })`.
- Prefetch payloads (and optionally begin streaming) before you create a GrowthBook instance with `prefetchPayload()`.
- New `debug` setting to turn on debug logging
- Changed the behavior of the `enableDevMode` option. Previously, setting this to true also disabled the SDK cache by default. Now, it does not and you must specify the additional setting `disableCache: true` to keep the same behavior as before.
- Network requests are no longer started when creating a GrowthBook instance. It now waits until `loadFeatures` (or the new `init`) is called.
- Many improvements to `auto.min.js` script
  - Payload hydration via `payload` context property
  - Support sticky bucketing via `useStickyBucketService` context property (accepts "cookie" and "localStorage"); override cookie or localStorage key via `stickyBucketPrefix` context property.
  - Hydrate sticky bucket docs by setting context `stickyBucketAssignmentDocs` (useful for SSR hydration without reliance on cookies)
  - Customize attributes/cookies via `uuidCookieName` (default "gbuuid") and `uuidKey` (default "id").
  - Force a uuid cookie write on load via `persistUuidOnLoad` (useful for SSR hydration)

## **0.36.0** - Mar 21, 2024

- Support for URL Redirect tests. New context options `navigate` (default `(url) => window.location.replace(url)`) and `navigateDelay` (default 100ms) for browsers. Plus, new method `getRedirectUrl()` for back-end/edge implementations.
- Built-in anti-flicker snippet. Set context option `antiFlicker` to true to enable (defualt false). Control timeout with option `antiFlickerTimeout` (default 3500ms)
- New methods to deal with deferred tracking calls and server/client hydration
  - `setTrackingCallback` - Set or update the trackingCallback after initialization. Until a trackingCallback is set, all calls will be queued up.
  - `getDeferredTrackingCalls` - Get all queued tracking calls (in JSON format)
  - `setDeferredTrackingCalls` - Hydrate the GrowthBook instance with queued tracking calls (in JSON format). Does not fire these calls immediately.
  - `fireDeferredTrackingCalls` - Manually fire all queued tracking calls.
- Various improvements to `auto.min.js` script
  - New `uuid` context property to use your own user id instead of the auto-generated one.
  - New `data-no-auto-cookies` script attribute and `growthbookpersist` event listener to more easily work with cookie consent banners
  - New `growthbookdata` DOM event to attach multiple renderers to a single GrowthBook instance
- Fix bug with prerequisite feature checks failing on initial page load when used with visual editor experiments

## **0.35.0** - Mar 8, 2024

- New `updateAttributes` method to make partial updates
- Fix missing `await` in RedisStickyBucketService
- New `context.renderer` option
- Various improvements to `auto.min.js` script
  - New `window.growthbook_queue` to make it easier to work with an async script tag
  - New `pageTitle` auto attribute
  - Fixed bugs with built-in GA4 and GTM tracking calls
  - New `growthbookrefresh` DOM event you can trigger to for re-evaluation of auto attributes

## **0.34.0** - Feb 20, 2024

- Prerequisite feature support for feature rules and experiments
- Fix bug feature repository would cache non-2xx responses when fetching features

## **0.33.0** - Jan 31, 2024

- Add new `maxAge` cache setting that limits how old cached features can be before we force a re-fetch from the server. Defaults to 24 hours.
- Fix broken visual editor preview links for multi-page experiments

## **0.32.0** - Jan 11, 2024

- Fix bug when visual editor loaded before `document.body` was available
- Sticky Bucketing support with built-in implementations for persisting in localStorage, cookies (both browser and Node.js), and Redis. Off by default, an implementation must be passed into the GrowthBook constructor to enable.
- The following methods are now async and return a Promise: `setAttributes`, `setAttributeOverrides`, `setForcedVariations`, `setURL`. No code changes are required since these all returned `void` prior to this.

## **0.31.0** - Nov 14, 2023

- Fix bug with multi-page visual editor experiments
- Add additional unit tests for comparison operators
- Fix auto-generated types when using JSON feature flags

## **0.30.0** - Oct 18, 2023

- Pause and resume streaming connections when the browser tab is hidden or visible. Can be disabled by setting `disableIdleStreams: false` via `configureCache()`. A 20sec idle timeout is used by default before pausing the connection; this can be configured by setting `idleStreamInterval` via `configureCache()`.
- Fix bug with `$exists` operator and undefined values
- Improvements and bug fixes when moving elements via the visual editor
- New `auto.js` pre-bundled script for simpler SDK integration on no/low code platforms

## **0.29.0** - Oct 4, 2023

- Add optional `remoteEval` mode for client-side applications (plus `cacheKeyAttributes` option to control when to re-fetch from the server)
- New options to better control network requests (useful for corporate proxies): `apiHostRequestHeaders`, `streamingHost`, and `streamingHostRequestHeaders`
- New public methods `getForcedVariations` and `getForcedFeatures` to see what's currently being overridden by DevTools, etc.
- Fix bug when using the GrowthBook DevTools Extension with Visual Editor experiments
- New `maxEntries` cache setting to enable garbage collection on the localStorage cache

## **0.28.0** - Aug 29, 2023

- Fix bug with streaming SSE connections only working on initial page load
- New context option `backgroundSync`. Set to false (default true) to disable opening a streaming connection to GrowthBook in the background
- New context option `subscribeToChanges`. Set to true (default false) to update the instance in realtime as features change in GrowthBook. This replaces the old `autoRefresh` setting (the old setting continues to work for backwards compatibility)
- Add missing types for TypeScript 5
- Add additional type exports `AutoExperiment` and `AutoExperimentVariation`

## **0.27.0** - May 23, 2023
