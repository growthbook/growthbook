# User Guide

The following sections will walk you through the various parts of the GrowthBook app.

- Create [Features](/app/features), integrate with our [SDKs](/lib), and use them to run experiments or control the behavior of your app.
- Connect to your [Data Sources](/app/datasources) so we can pull experiment results automatically.
- Define your [Metrics](/app/metrics) that you can use as goals and guardrails for experiments.
- Create an [Experiment Analysis](/app/experiments) and view results.
- Enable our [Visual Editor](/app/visual) (beta) so non-technical teammates can launch experiments without writing code.
- Integrate with our [API](/app/api) or [Webhooks](/app/webhooks) for a more seamless experience.
