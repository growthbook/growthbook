:::success New

The GrowthBook Java SDK is a brand new feature. If you experience any issues, let us know either on [Slack](https://slack.growthbook.io/) or [create an issue](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java/issues).

:::

## Installation

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java)

### Gradle

To install in a Gradle project, add Jitpack to your repositories, and then add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies.

<CodeTabsAddDependencyPartial />

### Maven

To install in a Maven project, add Jitpack to your repositories:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Next, add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.growthbook</groupId>
    <artifactId>growthbook-sdk-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are 2 steps to initializing the GrowthBook SDK:

1. Create a GrowthBook context `GBContext` with the features JSON and the user attributes
2. Create the `GrowthBook` SDK class with the context

### GrowthBook context

The GrowthBook context `GBContext` can be created either by implementing the builder class, available at `GBContext.builder()`, or by using the `GBContext` constructor.

| Field name            | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Using the GBContext builder

The builder is the easiest to use way to construct a `GBContext`, allowing you to provide as many or few arguments as you'd like. All fields mentioned above are available via the builder.

<CodeTabsGBContextBuilderPartial />

:::info Note
The above example uses `java.net.http.HttpClient` which, depending on your web framework, may not be the best option, in which case it is recommended to use a networking library more suitable for your implementation.
:::

#### Using the GBContext constructor

You can also use `GBContext` constructor if you prefer, which will require you to pass all arguments explicitly.

<CodeTabsGBContextConstructorPartial />

For complete examples, see the [Examples](#code-examples) section below.

#### Features

The features JSON is equivalent to the `features` property that is returned from the SDK Endpoint for the specified environment. You can find your endpoint on the [Environments &rarr; SDK Endpoints page <ExternalLink/>](https://app.growthbook.io/environments).

- You can read more [about features here](/app/features)
- You can see an [example features JSON here](/app/api#the-sdk-endpoint)

#### Attributes

Attributes are a JSON string. You can specify attributes about the current user and request. Here's an example:

<CodeTabsUserAttributesPartial />

If you need to set or update attributes asynchronously, you can do so with `Context#attributesJson` or `GrowthBook#setAttributes`. This will completely overwrite the attributes object with whatever you pass in. Also, be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully.

#### Tracking Callback

Any time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, we may call this callback so you can record the assigned value in your event tracking or analytics system of choice.

**The tracking callback is only called when the user is in the experiment**. If they are not in the experiment, this will not be called. If you'd like to subscribe to all evaluations, regardless of experiment result, see [Subscribing to experiment runs](#subscribing-to-experiment-runs-with-the-experimentruncallback).

<CodeTabsTrackingCallbackPartial />

### Using Features

Every feature has a "value" which is assigned to a user. This value can be any JSON data type. If a feature doesn't exist, the value will be `null`.

There are 4 main methods for evaluating features.

| Method                        | Return type            | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`isOn(String)`**            | `Boolean`              | Returns true if the value is a truthy value                                                                               |
| **`isOff(String)`**           | `Boolean`              | Returns true if the value is a falsy value                                                                                |
| **`getFeatureValue(String)`** | generic `T` (nullable) | Returns the value cast to the generic type. Type is inferred based on the `defaultValue` argument provided.               |
| **`evalFeature(String)`**     | `FeatureResult<T>`     | Returns a feature result with a value of generic type `T`. The value type needs to be specified in the generic parameter. |

<CodeTabsUsingFeaturesPartial />

#### isOn() / isOff()

These methods return a boolean for truthy and falsy values.

Only the following values are considered to be "falsy":

- `null`
- `false`
- `""`
- `0`

Everything else is considered "truthy", including empty arrays and objects.

If the value is "truthy", then `isOn()` will return true and `isOff()` will return false. If the value is "falsy", then the opposite values will be returned.

#### getFeatureValue(featureKey, defaultValue)

This method has a variety of overloads to help with casting values to primitive and complex types.

In short, the type of the `defaultValue` argument will determine the return type of the function.

| Return type             | Method                                                                                                     | Additional Info                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `<ValueType> ValueType` | **`getFeatureValue(String featureKey, ValueType defaultValue, Class<ValueType> gsonDeserializableClass)`** | Internally, the SDK uses Gson.

| `Object`                | **`getFeatureValue(String featureKey, Object defaultValue)`**                                              | Use this method if you need to cast a complex object that uses a custom deserializer, or if you use a different JSON serialization library than Gson, and cast the type yourself. |

[See the Java Docs](https://growthbook.github.io/growthbook-sdk-java/growthbook/sdk/java/GrowthBook.html) for more information.

[See the unit tests <ExternalLink />](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java/blob/main/lib/src/test/java/growthbook/sdk/java/GrowthBookTest.java#L220) for example implementations including type casting for all above-mentioned methods.

#### evalFeature(String)

The `evalFeature` method returns a `FeatureResult<T>` object with more info about why the feature was assigned to the user. The `T` type corresponds to the value type of the feature. In the above example, `T` is `Float`.

`FeatureResult<T>` It has the following getters.

| Method                      | Return type                           | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`getValue()`**            | generic `T` (nullable)                | The evaluated value of the feature                                                           |
| **`getSource()`**           | `enum FeatureResultSource` (nullable) | The reason/source for the evaluated feature value.                                           |
| **`getRuleId()`**           | `String` (nullable)                   | ID of the rule that was used to assign the value to the user.                                |
| **`getExperiment()`**       | `Experiment<T>` (nullable)            | The experiment details, available only if the feature evaluates due to an experiment.        |
| **`getExperimentResult()`** | `ExperimentResult<T>` (nullable)      | The experiment result details, available only if the feature evaluates due to an experiment. |

As expected in Kotlin, you can access these getters using property accessors.

### Inline Experiments

Instead of declaring all features up-front in the context and referencing them by IDs in your code, you can also just run an experiment directly. This is done with the `growthbook.run(Experiment<T>)` method.

<CodeTabsRunExperimentPartial />

#### Inline experiment return value ExperimentResult

An `ExperimentResult<T>` is returned where `T` is the generic value type for the experiment.

There's also a number of methods available.

| Method                   | Return type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`getValue()`**         | generic `T` (nullable) | The evaluated value of the feature                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`getVariationId()`**   | `Integer` (nullable)   | Index of the variation used, if applicable                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`getInExperiment()`**  | `Boolean`              | If the user was in the experiment. This will be false if the user was excluded from being part of the experiment for any reason (e.g. failed targeting conditions).                                          |

As expected in Kotlin, you can access these getters using property accessors.

### Subscribing to experiment runs with the ExperimentRunCallback

You can subscribe to experiment run evaluations using the `ExperimentRunCallback`.

<CodeTabsExperimentResultCallbackPartial />

Every time an experiment is evaluated when calling `growthBook.run(Experiment)`, the callbacks will be called.

You can subscribe with as many callbacks as you like:

<CodeTabsExperimentResultSubscribeMultipleCallbackPartial />

**The experiment run callback is called for every experiment run, regardless of experiment result**. If you would like to subscribe only to evaluations where the user falls into an experiment, see [TrackingCallback](#tracking-callback).

### Working with Encrypted features

As of version 0.3.0, the Java SDK supports decrypting encrypted features. You can learn more about [SDK Connection Endpoint Encryption](/app/api#encryption).

The main difference is you create a `GBContext` by passing an encryption key (`.encryptionKey()` when using the builder) and using the encrypted payload as the features JSON (`.featuresJson()` for the builder).

<CodeTabsGBContextBuilderEncryptedPartial />

### Fetching, Cacheing, and Refreshing features with GBFeaturesRepository

As of version 0.4.0, the Java SDK provides an optional `GBFeaturesRepository` class which will manage networking for you in the following ways:

- Fetching features from the SDK endpoint when `initialize()` is called
- Decrypting encrypted features when provided with the client key, e.g. `.builder().encryptionKey(clientKey)`
- Cacheing features (in-memory)
- Refreshing features

If you wish to manage fetching, refreshing, and cacheing features on your own, you can choose to not implement this class.

:::info Recommendation
This class should be implemented as a singleton class as it includes caching and refreshing functionality.
:::

If you have more than one SDK endpoint you'd like to implement, you can extend the `GBFeaturesRepository` class with your own class to make it easier to work with dependency injection frameworks. Each of these instances should be singletons.

#### Fetching the features

You will need to create a singleton instance of the `GBFeaturesRepository` class either by implementing its `.builder()` or by using its constructor.

Then, you would call `myGbFeaturesRepositoryInstance.initialize()` in order to make the initial (blocking) request to fetch the features. Then, you would call `myGbFeaturesRepositoryInstance.getFeaturesJson()` and provided that to the `GBContext` initialization.

<CodeTabsFeaturesRepository />

For more references, see the [Examples](#code-examples) below.

#### Cacheing and refreshing behaviour

The `GBFeaturesRepository` will automatically refresh the features when the features become stale. Features are considered stale every 60 seconds. This amount is configurable with the `ttlSeconds` option.

When you fetch features and they are considered stale, the stale features are returned from the `getFeaturesJson()` method and a network call to refresh the features is enqueued asynchronously. When that request succeeds, the features are updated with the newest features, and the next call to `getFeaturesJson()` will return the refreshed features.

## Overriding Feature Values

The Java SDK allows you to override feature values and experiments using the URL.

### Force Experiment Variations

You can force an experiment variation by passing the experiment key and variation index as query parameters in the URL you set on the `GBContext`. For example, if you add `?my-experiment-id=2` to the URL, users will be forced into the variation at index 2 in the variations list when evaluating the experiment with key `my-experiment-id`.

### Force Feature Values via the URL

You can force a value for a feature by passing the key, prefixed by `gb~`, and the URI-encoded value in the URL's query parameters. You must also set `allowUrlOverrides` to true when building your `GBContext` in order to enable this feature as it is not enabled by default.

```java
GBContext context = GBContext
    .builder()
    .url("http://localhost:8080/url-feature-force?gb~dark_mode=true&gb~donut_price=3.33&gb~banner_text=Hello%2C%20everyone!%20I%20hope%20you%20are%20all%20doing%20well!")
    .allowUrlOverrides(true)
    .build();
```

The above code sample sets the following:

- `dark_mode`: `true`
- `banner_text`: `"Hello, everyone! I hope you are all doing well!"`
- `donut_price`: `3.33`

#### Supported types

| Type                          | Value                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `String`                      | A URI-encoded string value                                                                                                                     |
| `Float`                       | A float value, e.g. `3.33`                                                                                                                     |
| `Double`                      | A double value, e.g. `3.33`                                                                                                                    |
| `Integer`                     | An integer value, e.g. `1337`                                                                                                                  |
| `Boolean`                     | A boolean value, e.g. `true` or `false`. You can also represent boolean values with on/off state as `on` or `off` or binary values `1` or `0`. |
| JSON as `Gson`-deserializable | A class that can be deserialized using Gson and that does not have any dependencies on custom type adapters.                                   |
| JSON as `String`              | A URI-encoded string value that should be a valid JSON string that you can deserialize with your own JSON deserialization implementation.      |

The value passed in the URL is cast at runtime based on the generic type argument passed in when evaluating the feature. This means that when you call `<ValueType>getFeatureValue()`, what you pass into the URL must successfully cast as `ValueType` otherwise the value in the URL will be ignored.

All keys must be prefixed with `gb~`.

## Using with Proguard and R8

Many Android projects use code-shrinking and obfuscation tools like Proguard and R8 in production.

If you are experiencing unexpected feature evaluation results with your release Android builds that do not occur in your debug builds, it's most likely related to this.

You will need to add the following to your `proguard-rules.pro` file to ensure that all of the GrowthBook SDK classes are kept so that your features are evaluated properly in projects that use Proguard and R8:

```
# Growthbook Java SDK classes
-keep class growthbook.sdk.java.** { *; }
```
