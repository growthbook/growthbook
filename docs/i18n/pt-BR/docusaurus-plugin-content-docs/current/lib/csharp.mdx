## Installation

```csharp
    dotnet add package growthbook-c-sharp
```

## Quick Usage

This library is based on the [GrowthBook SDK specs](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/build-your-own) and should be compatible with the usage examples in the [GrowthBook docs](https://docs.growthbook.io/).

Down below you'll find two basic examples on how the package works.

### Basic

1. Declare features

   ```csharp

   var staticFeatures = new Dictionary<string, Feature>
   {
       {"firstFeature", new Feature{ DefaultValue = true}},
       {"secondFeature", new Feature{ DefaultValue = false}}
   };
   ```

2. Create a context and add the features

   ```csharp
   var context = new Context
   {
       Enabled = true,
       Url = "",
       Features = staticFeatures
   };
   ```

3. Create the `GrowthBook` object with the context

   ```csharp
   using GrowthBook;
   //...

   var GrowthBook = new GrowthBook.GrowthBook(context);
   ```

4. Check whether a feature is enabled

   ```csharp
   GrowthBook.IsOn("firstFeature") // true
   GrowthBook.IsOn("secondFeature") // false
   ```

### Loading feature definitions from an API

Because feature definitions are typically loaded from API calls or cache, [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/13.0.2-beta1)
objects are used to represent arbitrary document types such as Attributes, Conditions, and Feature values.

To load your features from the GrowthBook API use the following example:

1. Create a result model for the API response

   ```csharp
   public class FeaturesResult
   {
       public HttpStatusCode Status { get; set; }
       public IDictionary<string, Feature>? Features { get; set; }
       public DateTimeOffset? DateUpdated { get; set; }
   }
   ```

2. call the endpoint and deserialize result

   ```csharp
   var url = "YOUR_GROWTHBOOK_URL/api/features/YOUR_API_KEY";
   var response = await client.GetAsync(url);

   if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
   {
       var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
       var featuresResult = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<FeaturesResult>(content);
   }
   ```

3. Construct a context and initialize GrowthBook

   ```csharp
   var GrowthBook = new GrowthBook.GrowthBook(
       new Context {
           Enabled = true,
           Url = "",
           Features = featuresResult.Features,
       }
   );
   ```

#### Generic getters

To make it easier to deal with Feature values, generic getter functions are provided for the following:

- Experiment:
  - `GetVariations<T>()`
- ExperimentResult:
  - `GetValue<T>()`
- Feature:
  - `GetDefaultValue<T>()`
- FeatureResult:
  - `GetValue<T>()`
- Feature Rule:
  - `GetVariations<T>()`
- GrowthBook:
  - `GetFeatureValue<T>(string key, T fallback)`
