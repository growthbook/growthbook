# GrowthBook Go SDK

## Installation

```
go get github.com/growthbook/growthbook-golang
```

## Quick Usage

The main public API for the SDK is provided through the `Context` and
`GrowthBook` types. The `Context` type provides a means to pass
settings to the main `GrowthBook` type, while the `GrowthBook` type
provides a `Feature` method for accessing feature values, and a `Run`
method for running inline experiments.

```go
// GBFeaturesResponse
// GrowthBook features response
type GBFeaturesResponse struct {
	Status            int             `json:"status"`
	Features          json.RawMessage `json:"features"`
	EncryptedFeatures string          `json:"encryptedFeatures,omitempty"` // Not yet supported in the Go SDK
	DateUpdated       time.Time       `json:"dateUpdated"`
}

// Get JSON from GrowthBook and deserialize it into GBFeaturesResponse struct
res, err := http.Get("https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/<environment_key>")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Error fetching features from GrowthBook: %s \n", err)
	os.Exit(1)
}

var featuresResponse GBFeaturesResponse
err = json.NewDecoder(res.Body).Decode(&featuresResponse)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Error decoding JSON: %s \n", err)
	os.Exit(1)
}

features := growthbook.ParseFeatureMap(featuresResponse.Features)

// Optional tracking callback
// This will get called when the font_colour experiment below is evaluated
// See "Tracking and subscriptions" section below
trackingCallback := func(experiment *growthbook.Experiment, result *growthbook.ExperimentResult) {
	fmt.Printf("Experiment Viewed: %s - Variation index: %d - Value: %s \n", experiment.Key, result.VariationID, result.Value)
}

// Set up user attributes - See Attributes below for more info
userAttributes := growthbook.Attributes{
	"id": "user-abc123",
	"country": "canada",
}

// Create a growthbook.Context instance with the features and attributes
context := growthbook.NewContext().
	WithFeatures(features).
	WithAttributes(userAttributes).
	WithTrackingCallback(trackingCallback)

// Create a growthbook.GrowthBook instance
gb := growthbook.New(context)

// Get a string value
bannerText := gb.Feature("banner_text").GetValueWithDefault("(unknown banner text)")

// Perform feature test.
if gb.Feature("dark_mode").On {
	// ...
}

// Evaluate an inline experiment and cast the result to a string (or the known type)
experiment := growthbook.
	NewExperiment("font_colour").
	WithVariations("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
result := gb.Run(experiment)
var fontColour = result.Value.(string)

fmt.Println(fontColour)

experiment2 :=
  growthbook.NewExperiment("complex-experiment").
    WithVariations(
      map[string]string{"color": "blue", "size": "small"},
      map[string]string{"color": "green", "size": "large"},
    ).
    WithWeights(0.8, 0.2).
    WithCoverage(0.5)

result2 := gb.Run(experiment2)
fmt.Println(result2.Value.(map[string]string)["color"],
  result2.Value.(map[string]string)["size"])
```

## The GrowthBook Context

A new `Context` is created using the `NewContext` function and its
fields can be set using the `WithEnabled`, `WithAttributes`,
`WithURL`, `WithFeatures`, `WithForcedVariations`, `WithQAMode` and
`WithTrackingCallback` methods. These `With...` methods return a
`Context` pointer to enable call chaining. Context details can
alternatively be parsed from JSON data (see [JSON data
representations](#json-data-representations)). The fields in a
`Context` include information about the user for whom feature results
will be evaluated (the `Attributes`), the features that are defined,
plus some additional values to control forcing of feature results
under some circumstances.

Given a `Context` value, a new `GrowthBook` value can be created using
the `New` function. The `GrowthBook` type has some getter and setter
methods (setters are methods with names of the form `With...`) for
fields of the associated `Context`. As well as providing access to the
underlying Context and exposing the main `Feature` and `Run` methods,
the `GrowthBook` type also keeps track of the results of experiments
that are performed, in order to implement tracking and experiment
subscription callbacks.

For example, assuming that the `growthbook` package is imported with
name "`growthbook`", the following code will create a `Context` and
`GrowthBook` value using features parsed from JSON data and some fixed
attributes:

```go
// Parse feature map from JSON.
features := growthbook.ParseFeatureMap(featureJSON)

// Create context and main GrowthBook object.
context := growthbook.NewContext().
  WithFeatures(features).
  WithAttributes(growthbook.Attributes{
    "country": "US",
    "browser": "firefox",
  })
gb := growthbook.New(context)
```

### Features

The `WithFeatures` method of `Context` takes a `FeatureMap` value,
which is defined as `map[string]*Feature`, and which can be created
from JSON data using the `ParseFeatureMap` function (see [JSON data
representations](#json-data-representations)). You can pass a feature
map generated this way to the `WithFeatures` method of `Context` or
`GrowthBook`:

```go
featureMap := ParseFeatureMap([]byte(
  `{ "feature-1": {...},
     "feature-2": {...},
     "another-feature": {...}
   }`))

gb := NewContext().WithFeatures(featureMap)
```

If you need to load feature definitions from a remote source like an
API or database, you can update the context at any time with
`WithFeatures`.

If you use the GrowthBook App to manage your features, you don't need
to build this JSON file yourself -- it will auto-generate one for you
and make it available via an API endpoint.

If you prefer to build this file by hand or you want to know how it
works under the hood, check out the detailed [Feature
Definitions](#feature-definitions) section below.

### Attributes

You can specify attributes about the current user and request. These
are used for two things:

- Feature targeting (e.g. paid users get one value, free users get
  another);
- Assigning persistent variations in A/B tests (e.g. user id "123"
  always gets variation B).

Attributes can be any JSON data type -- boolean, integer, string,
array, or object and are represented by the `Attributes` type, which
is an alias for the generic `map[string]interface{}` type that Go uses
for JSON objects. If you know them up front, you can pass them into
`Context` or `GrowthBook` using `WithAttributes`:

```go
gb := growthbook.New(context).
  WithAttributes(Attributes{
    "id":       "123",
    "loggedIn": true,
    "deviceId": "abc123def456",
    "company":  "acme",
    "paid":     false,
    "url":      "/pricing",
    "browser":  "chrome",
    "mobile":   false,
    "country":  "US",
  })
```

You can also set or update attributes asynchronously at any time with
the `WithAttributes` method. This will completely overwrite the
attributes object with whatever you pass in. If you want to merge
attributes instead, you can get the existing ones with `Attributes`:

```go
attrs := gb.Attributes()
attrs["url"] = "/checkout"
gb.WithAttributes(attrs)
```

Be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature
values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully. A
common approach is to only refresh attributes on navigation, when the
window is focused, and/or after a user performs a major action like
logging in.

### Tracking Callback

Any time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, we
can run a callback function so you can record the assigned value in
your event tracking or analytics system of choice.

```go
context.WithTrackingCallback(func(experiment *growthbook.Experiment,
  result *growthbook.ExperimentResult) {
    // Example using Segment.io
    client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
      UserId: context.Attributes()["id"],
      Event: "Experiment Viewed",
      Properties: analytics.NewProperties().
        Set("experimentId", experiment.Key).
        Set("variationId", result.VariationID)
    })
  }
)
```

## Error handling

The GrowthBook public API does not return errors under any normal
circumstances. The intention is for developers to be able to use the
SDK in both development and production smoothly. To this end, error
reporting is provided by a configurable logging interface.

For development use, the `DevLogger` type provides a suitable
implementation of the logging interface: it prints all logged messages
to standard output, and exits on errors.

For production use, a logger that directs log messages to a suitable
centralised logging facility and ignores all errors would be suitable.
The logger can of course also signal error and warning conditions to
other parts of the program in which it is used.

To be specific about this:

- None of the functions that create or update `Context`, `GrowthBook`
  or `Experiment` values return errors.

- The main `GrowthBook.Feature` and `GrowthBook.Run` methods never
  return errors.

- None of the functions that create values from JSON data return
  errors.

For most common use cases, this means that the GrowthBook SDK can be
used transparently, without needing to care about error handling. Your
server code will never crash because of problems in the GrowthBook
SDK. The only effect of error conditions in the inputs to the SDK may
be that feature values and results of experiments are not what you
expect.

## Using Features

The main method, `GrowthBook.Feature(key)`, takes a feature key and
uses the stored feature definitions and attributes to evaluate the
feature value. It returns a `FeatureResult` value with the following
fields:

- `Value`: the JSON value of the feature (or null if not defined), as
  a `FeatureValue` value (which is just an alias for `interface{}`,
  using Go's default behavior for handling JSON values);
- `On` and `Off`: the JSON value cast to booleans (to make your code
  easier to read);
- `Source`: a value of type `FeatureResultSource`, telling why the
  value was assigned to the user. One of
  `UnknownFeatureResultSource`, `DefaultValueResultSource`,
  `ForceResultSource`, or `ExperimentResultSource`.
- `Experiment`: information about the experiment (if any) which was
  used to assign the value to the user.
- `ExperimentResult`: the result of the experiment (if any) which was
  used to assign the value to the user.

Here's an example that uses all of them:

```go
result := gb.Feature("my-feature")

// The JSON value (might be null, string, boolean, number, array, or
// object).
fmt.Println(result.Value)

if result.On {
  // Feature value is truthy (in a Javascript sense)
}
if result.Off {
  // Feature value is falsy
}

// If the feature value was assigned as part of an experiment
if result.Source == growthbook.ExperimentResultSource {
  // Get all the possible variations that could have been assigned
  fmt.Println(result.Experiment.Variations)
}
```

Defaulting of the values of feature results is assisted by the
`GetValueWithDefault` method on the `FeatureResult` type. For example,
this code evaluates the result of a feature and returns the feature
value, defaulting to "blue" if the feature has no value:

```go
color := gb.Feature("signup-button-color").GetValueWithDefault("blue")
```

## Feature Definitions

For details of the JSON format used for feature definitions, consult
the documentation for the [GrowthBook Javascript
SDK](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/js). The Go SDK uses exactly the
same logic for processing features, and can ingest the same JSON
feature definitions as are used by the Javascript SDK (see [JSON data
representations](#json-data-representations)).

It is possible to create `Feature` values in the Go SDK by hand,
simply by creating Go values of the appropriate types (`Feature`,
`FeatureValue`, `FeatureRule`), but the most common use case is
likely to be ingesting feature definitions from JSON data using the
`ParseFeatureMap` function.

## Inline Experiments

Experiments can be defined and run using the `Experiment` type and the
`Run` method of the `GrowthBook` type. Experiment definitions can be
created directly as values of the `Experiment` type, or parsed from
JSON definitions using the `ParseExperiment` function. Passing an
`Experiment` value to the `Run` method of the `GrowthBook` type will
run the experiment, returing an `ExperimentResult` value that contains
the resulting feature value. This allows users to run arbitrary
experiments without providing feature definitions up-front.

```go
experiment :=
  growthbook.NewExperiment("my-experiment").
    WithVariations("red", "blue", "green")

result := gb.Run(experiment)
```

All other experiment settings (weights, hash attribute, coverage,
namespace, condition) are supported when using inline experiments: the
`Experiment` type has `With...` methods that allow these fields to be
set easily (i.e. `WithWeights`, `WithHashAttribute`, `WithCoverage`,
`WithNamespace`, `WithCondition`).

In addition, there are a few other settings that only really make
sense for inline experiments:

- `Force` can be set to one of the variation array indexes. Everyone
  will be immediately assigned the specified value.
- `Active` can be set to `false` to disable the experiment and return
  the control for everyone.

### Inline Experiment Return Value

A call to `GrowthBook.Run(experiment)` returns a value of type
`*ExperimentResult`:

```go
experiment := growthbook.NewExperiment("my-experiment").
  WithVariations("A", "B")
result := gb.Run(experiment)

// If user is part of the experiment
fmt.Println(result.InExperiment) // true or false

// The index of the assigned variation
fmt.Println(result.VariationID) // 0 or 1

// The value of the assigned variation
fmt.Println(result.Value) // "A" or "B"

// The user attribute used to assign a variation
fmt.Println(result.HashAttribute) // "id"

// The value of that attribute
fmt.Println(result.HashValue) // e.g. "123"
```

The `InExperiment` flag is only set to true if the user was randomly
assigned a variation. If the user failed any targeting rules or was
forced into a specific variation, this flag will be false.

## JSON data representations

For interoperability of the GrowthBook Go SDK with versions of the SDK
in other languages, the core "input" values of the SDK (in particular,
`Context` and `Experiment` values and maps of feature definitions) can
be created by parsing JSON data.

A common use case is to download the feature definition from the GrowthBook SDK endpoints, and parse them into a feature map that can be passed into the GrowthBook `Context`.

The shape of the GrowthBook response can use the following struct:

```go
// GBFeaturesResponse
// GrowthBook features response
type GBFeaturesResponse struct {
	Status            int             `json:"status"`
	Features          json.RawMessage `json:"features"`
	EncryptedFeatures string          `json:"encryptedFeatures,omitempty"` // Not yet supported in the Go SDK
	DateUpdated       time.Time       `json:"dateUpdated"`
}
```

Next, get JSON from GrowthBook and deserialize it into GBFeaturesResponse struct.

```go
res, err := http.Get("https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/<environment_key>")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Error fetching features from GrowthBook: %s \n", err)
	os.Exit(1)
}

var featuresResponse GBFeaturesResponse
err = json.NewDecoder(res.Body).Decode(&featuresResponse)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("Error decoding JSON: %s \n", err)
	os.Exit(1)
}

features := growthbook.ParseFeatureMap(featuresResponse.Features)

// Create a growthbook.Context instance with the features and attributes
context := growthbook.NewContext().
	WithFeatures(features).
	WithAttributes(userAttributes)

// Create a growthbook.GrowthBook instance
gb := growthbook.New(context)
```

The functions that implement this JSON processing functionality have
names like `ParseContext`, `BuildContext`, and so on. Each `Parse...`
function process raw JSON data (as a `[]byte` value), while the
`Build...` functions process JSON objects unmarshalled to Go values of
type `map[string]interface{}`. This provides flexibility in ingestion
of JSON data.

## Tracking and subscriptions

The `Context` value supports a "tracking callback", which is a
function that is called any time an experiment is run to determine the
value of a feature, so that users can record the assigned value in an
external event tracking or analytics system.

In addition to the tracking callback, the `GrowthBook` type also
supports more general "subscriptions", which are callback functions
that are called any time `Run` is called, irrespective of whether or
not a user is included in an experiment. The subscription system
ensures that subscription callbacks are only called when the result of
an experiment changes, or a new experiment is run.
