# Importing External Experiments

GrowthBook can analyze experiments that are run on another service or platform so long as they exist in your linked Data Source. To do this, we create a dedicated experiment in GrowthBook that links to your data warehouse via the experiment metadata.

To import an experiment, select Create Experiment from the Experiment page and then select Import.

## Importing Experiments

When you choose to Import an Existing Experiment, we show you the following modal:

<img
  src="/images/import-experiment-modal.png"
  alt="Experiment Import Modal"
  style={{ width: 600, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

On this modal you can either create an experiment using some metadata that we infer from your metric source using the Import buttons on the right hand side.
You can also manually create an experiment from scratch.
