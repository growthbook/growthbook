# SDK Webhooks

GrowthBook has event-based webhooks that trigger a script on your server whenever something changes within GrowthBook.

## Adding a Webhook

When logged into GrowthBook as an admin, navigate to **SDK Configuration â†’ SDK Connections**.

Under the SDK Webhooks section you can add a webhook endpoint and select with method you would like to be notified with `POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, PURGE`.

Once a SDK webhook is created you will be able to view the secrete and when the last time it was fired as well as if there was an error.

### VPCs and Firewalls

If your webhook endpoint is behind a firewall and you are using GrowthBook Cloud, make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40`.

## Verify Signatures

Webhook payloads are signed with a shared secret so you can verify they actually came from GrowthBook. The signature is passed in a `webhook-secret` header.
We are using the `whsec_` prefix to help identify the crypto encoding method. For example: `webhook-secret:"whsec_iM0hCLU0fZc885zfkFPX3UJwSHbYyam9ji0WglnT3fc="`

Here is example code in NodeJS for verifying the signature. Other languages should be similar:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

// Retrieve from GrowthBook settings
const GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "abc123";

const port = 1337;
const app = express();

app.post(
  "/webhook",
  bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;
    const received = req.get("webhook-secret");
    if (received && received.startsWith("whsec_")) {
      const signingKey = received.split("whsec_")[1];
      const computed = crypto
        .createHmac("sha256", signingKey || "")
        .update(res.locals.rawBody || new Buffer(""))
        .digest("hex");

      if (
        !crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(computed), Buffer.from(signingKey))
      ) {
        throw new Error("mismatch signatures");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error("invalid secret");
    }

    const data = JSON.parse(payload);
    // TODO: Do something with the webhook data

    // Make sure to respond with a 200 status code
    res.status(200).send("");
  }
);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Webhook endpoint listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Errors and Retries

If your endpoint returns any HTTP status besides `200`, the webhook will be considered failed.

Failed webhooks are tried a total of 3 times using an exponential back-off between attempts.

You can view the status of your webhooks in the GrowthBook app under **SDK Connections**.

## Supported HTTP Types

- **POST**
- **PUT**
- **GET**
- **DELETE**
- **PURGE**

### Sending Payload

SDK Webhooks will optionally send the payload to the endpoint **except GET.** In body is a JSON object containing feature definitions in the same format that SDKs are expecting.

Here's an example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1625098156,
  "features": {
    "feature1": {
      "defaultValue": true
    }
  }
}

```
