# SDK Webhooks

GrowthBook has SDK-based webhooks that trigger a script on your server whenever something changes within GrowthBook which will affect that SDK.

## Adding a Webhook

When logged into GrowthBook as an admin, navigate to **SDK Connections** and select an existing SDK Connection.

Under the SDK Webhooks section you can add a webhook.

There are built-in webhook types for syncing to **Cloudflare KV**, **Fastly KV**, and **Vercel Edge Config**. For everything else, you can configure a generic **HTTP Endpoint** to be hit.

Once a SDK webhook is created you will be able to view the status and fire a test event.

### VPCs and Firewalls

If your webhook endpoint is behind a firewall and you are using GrowthBook Cloud, make sure to whitelist the ip address `52.70.79.40`.

## Verify Signatures

SDK Webhook payloads are signed with a shared secret so you can verify they actually came from GrowthBook.

### Standard Webhooks

We follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) specification, so you can use any of their SDKs to verify our webhook signatures.

```ts
import { Webhook } from "standardwebhooks"

const wh = new Webhook(base64_secret);
wh.verify(webhook_body, webhook_headers);
```

### Custom Verification

Webhook requests sent to your endpoint include 3 headers:

- `webhook-id` - The unique id for this event
- `webhook-timestamp` - The unix integer timestamp of the event
- `webhook-signature` - The signature (format described below)

To create the signature, we concatenate the `webhook-id`, the `webhook-timestamp`, and the body contents, all separated by dots (`.`). Then, we create an HMAC SHA-256 hash of this using the shared secret.

What we set in the `webhook-signature` header is the hashing algorithm identifier for HMAC SHA-256 (`v1`), followed by a comma (`,`), followed by the base64-encoded hash from above. For example:

```
v1,K5oZfzN95Z9UVu1EsfQmfVNQhnkZ2pj9o9NDN/H/pI4=
```

You can find the shared secret via **SDK Configuration â†’ SDK Connections**, choosing the connection, and viewing your webhook's details.

Here is example code in NodeJS for verifying the signature. Other languages should be similar:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

// Retrieve from GrowthBook SDK connection settings
const GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "wk_123A5341464B3A13";

const port = 1337;
const app = express();
app.post(
  "/webhook",
  bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (req, res) => {
    // If there is no body sent, use an empty string to compute the signature
    const body = req.body || "";

    // Get the request headers
    const id = req.get("webhook-id");
    const timestamp = req.get("webhook-timestamp");
    const rawSignature = req.get("webhook-signature") || "";

    // Remove the "v1," prefix from the signature for comparison
    const signature = rawSignature.split(",")[1];

    if (id && timestamp && signature) {

      // Compute the signature
      const computed = crypto
        .createHmac("sha256", GROWTHBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
        .update(`${id}.${timestamp}.${body}`)
        .digest("base64");

      if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(computed), Buffer.from(signature))) {
        throw new Error("Invalid signature");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error("Missing signature headers");
    }

    const parsedBody = JSON.parse(body);
    const payload = parsedBody.data.payload;
    // TODO: Do something with the webhook data

    // Make sure to respond with a 200 status code
    res.status(200).send("");
  }
);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Webhook endpoint listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Errors and Retries

If your endpoint returns any HTTP status besides `200`, the webhook will be considered failed.

Webhooks are retried up to 2 additional times with an exponential back-off between attempts.

You can view the status of your webhooks in the GrowthBook app under **SDK Connections**.

## Supported HTTP Methods

- **GET**
- **POST**
- **PUT**
- **DELETE**
- **PURGE**
- **PATCH**

## Payload Format

For all methods other than `GET`, you may send a payload body. By default, webhooks will send in the "Standard" format.

### Standard

Follows the **Standard Webhooks** specification. Inludes a JSON-encoded SDK Payload in the `data.payload` field.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "type": "payload.changed",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-03T01:54:20.449Z",
  "data": {
    "payload": "{\"features\":{\"my-feature\":{\"defaultValue\":true}}}"
  }
}
```

The `data.payload` object contains the exact JSON format that our SDKs are expecting. For example, you can pass this directly into the JavaScript SDK:

```ts
const payload = JSON.parse(parsedBody.data.payload);

const gb = new GrowthBook();
await gb.init({
  payload: payload
});
```

### Standard (no SDK Payload)

Same as above, but without the `data.payload` field.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "type": "payload.changed",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-03T01:54:20.449Z",
}
```

### SDK Payload

Sends the raw SDK Payload using the same format as our SDK features endpoint. This is usually the correct format if you are using the webhook to set
a cache value or assigning key/value storage.

Example payload:

```json
{"features":{"my-feature":{"defaultValue":true}}}
```

### Vercel Edge Config

Formats the body to work directly with Vercel's Edge Config API.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "operation": "upsert",
      "key": "gb_payload",
      "value": "{\"features\":{\"my-feature\":{\"defaultValue\":true}}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

In order for this to work properly, you must specify the following options as well, replacing the `your_*` placeholders with actual values.

- Endpoint URL = `https://api.vercel.com/v1/edge-config/your_edge_config_id_here/items`
- HTTP Method = `PATCH`
- Headers = `{ "Authorization": "Bearer your_vercel_api_token_here" }`
- Payload Key = `your_value_key_here` (defaults to `gb_payload` if left blank)

:::tip

If you are updating an Edge Config item owned by a team, add `?teamId=your_team_id_here` to the end of your Endpoint URL.
