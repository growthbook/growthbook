:::note

Global SDK Webhooks are only available for self-hosted GrowthBook installations.

:::

Global SDK Webhooks are similar to [SDK webhooks](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks), but are not limited to a single SDK Connection. They are defined by environment variables, allowing them to be configured outside of the GrowthBook app UI.

When any SDK Connection payloads change, GrowthBook will ping and optionally send all changed SDK payloads to each of your defined global webhooks.

## Setup

Define a `WEBHOOKS` environment variable as a JSON string of an array of global webhook objects. For example:

```bash
WEBHOOKS='[{"url":"https://webhook.mysite.io","signingKey":"key_1234","method":"POST","headers":{"X-Custom-Header":"foo"},"sendPayload":true}]'
```

A global webhook object takes the following form:

```typescript
{
  url: string,
  signingKey: string,
  method: string, // "GET" | "PUT" | "POST" | "PURGE" | "DELETE"
  headers: object,
  sendPayload: boolean // Include the SDK Payload in the body (not available for GET)
}
```

### Authentication

The `signingKey` is used for authentication. Typically you should use either a generated **Secret API Key** (Settings → API Keys) or a **Personal Access Token** (User menu → My personal access tokens).

#### Multi-org configuration

If you want your global webhooks to span across multiple organizations, then you must use a **Personal Access Token** generated by a **Super Admin** user.

:::tip

Super Admin users are organization members with both:

1. An **Admin** role assigned in multiple organizations within your GrowthBook instance
2. `superAdmin: true` manually set in your Mongo `users` collection

:::

Once a Global SDK Webhook is declared with a Super Admin's Personal Access Token for the `signingKey` field, then it will be capable of receiving notifications across all of the Super Admin's organizations.

## Verify Signatures

**See: [SDK Webhooks - Verify Signatures](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks#verify-signatures)**

## Errors and Retries

**See: [SDK Webhooks - Errors and Retries](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks#errors-and-retries)**

One key difference is that there is no UI for viewing the send status or logs for global webhooks. You may wish to manually consume the webhook logs found in the Mongo `sdkwebhooklogs` collection.
