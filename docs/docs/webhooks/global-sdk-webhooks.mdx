:::note

Global SDK Webhooks are only available for self-hosted GrowthBook installations.

:::

Global SDK Webhooks are just like [SDK Webhooks](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks), but configured via environment variables instead of the GrowthBook UI.

When any SDK Connection payloads changes in any organization, all of your Global SDK Webhooks will be triggered.

## Setup

Define a `WEBHOOKS` environment variable as a JSON string of an array of global webhook objects.

The only required field for a global webhook is **`url`**. Here's a minimal example:

```
[{"url":"https://example.com"}]
```

There are additional fields you can specify:

- **`signingKey`** (string) - Will be used to add a signature header that enables you to verify the webhook origin
- **`method`** (string) - One of `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PURGE`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. Defaults to `POST` if omitted
- **`headers`** (object) - Additional headers to add to the webhook request. Useful for adding auth headers for example. Default `{}`.
- **`payloadFormat`** (string) - How to format the body (ignored when method = "GET"). One of `standard`, `standard-no-payload`, `sdkPayload`, `edgeConfig` or `none`. Defaults to `standard`. Read more about the different formats in the SDK Webhooks [Payload Format docs](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks#payload-format).
- **`payloadKey`** (string) - Only used when payloadFormat is set to `edgeConfig`. The key in Vercel Edge Config you want to update.

_Deprecated:_

- **`sendPayload`** (boolean) - Whether or not to include the full SDK Payload in the body. `true` maps to `payloadFormat = standard`; false maps to `payloadFormat = standard-no-payload`.

Here's a full example using all of the fields:

```
[{"url":"https://example.com","signingKey":"abc123","method":"PUT","headers":{"X-Custom-Header":"foo"},"payloadFormat":"sdkPayload"}]
```

## Verify Signatures

If you define a `signingKey`, you can use it to verify that webhooks are coming from GrowthBook.

**See: [SDK Webhooks - Verify Signatures](/app/webhooks/sdk-webhooks#verify-signatures)**

## Errors and Retries

Unlike normal SDK Webhooks, Global SDK Webhooks are NOT retried on error.

On failure, they will output container logs as well as save them to the Mongo `sdkwebhooklogs` collection.
