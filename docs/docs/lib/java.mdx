# Java

This supports Java applications using Java version 1.8 and higher.

## Installation

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java)

### Gradle

To install in a Gradle project, add Jitpack to your repositories, and then add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies.

<CodeTabsAddDependencyPartial />

### Maven

To install in a Maven project, add Jitpack to your repositories:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Next, add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.growthbook</groupId>
    <artifactId>growthbook-sdk-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are 2 steps to initializing the GrowthBook SDK:

1. Create a GrowthBook context `GBContext` with the features JSON and the user attributes
2. Create the `GrowthBook` SDK class with the context

### GrowthBook context

The GrowthBook context `GBContext` can be created either by implementing the builder class, or by implementing the static method `create()`.

- the `featureJson` method takes a JSON string that is equivalent to the `features` property that is returned from the SDK Endpoint for the specified environment. You can find your endpoint on the [Settings &rarr; API Keys page <ExternalLink/>](https://app.growthbook.io/settings/keys).
- the `attributesJson` method takes a JSON string of the user attributes, e.g. `{ "id": 100, "country": "canada" }`

#### Using the Builder class

The builder is the easiest to use way to construct a `GBContext`, allowing you to provide as many or few arguments as you'd like:

<CodeTabsGBContextBuilderPartial />

#### Using the static create() method

You can also use the static method `create()` if you prefer, which will require you to pass all arguments. All arguments passed are available to be set using the builder above:

<CodeTabsGBContextStaticCreatePartial />

The implementation of this method actually uses [the builder mentioned above](#using-the-builder-class).

For complete examples, see the [Examples](#examples) section below.

#### Features

todo

#### Attributes

Attributes are a JSON string. You can specify attributes about the current user and request. Here's an example:

```java
// Java example
String userAttributes = "{\"country\": \"canada\", \"id\": \"user-abc123\"}";
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin example
val userAttributes = """
    {
        "id": "user-abc123",
        "country": "canada"
    }
""".trimIndent()
```

If you need to set or update attributes asynchronously, you can do so with `Context#attributesJson` or `GrowthBook#setAttributes`. This will completely overwrite the attributes object with whatever you pass in. Also, be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully.

#### Tracking Callback

Any time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, we call a function so you can record the assigned value in your event tracking or analytics system of choice.

<CodeTabsTrackingCallbackPartial />

### Using Features

Every feature has a "value" which is assigned to a user. This value can be any JSON data type. If a feature doesn't exist, the value will be `null`.

There are 4 main methods for evaluating features:

- **isOn()** - returns a boolean for a truthy value
- **isOff()** - returns a boolean for a falsy value
- **getFeatureValue()** - returns a generic value. Type is inferred based on the `defaultValue` argument provided.
- **evalFeature()** - returns a feature result `FeatureResult<T>`. The value type needs to be specified in the generic parameter.

<CodeTabsUsingFeaturesPartial />

The `evalFeature` method returns a `FeatureResult<T>` object with more info about why the feature was assigned to the user. The `T` type corresponds to the value type of the feature.

`FeatureResult<T>` It has the following getters:

- **getValue()** - a nullable value of the feature
- **getSource()** - a nullable enum for the source of the result. Why the value was assigned to the user
- **getRuleId()** - a nullable string ID of the rule that was used to assign the value to the user
- **getExperiment()** - a nullable experiment `Experiment<T>`, if the value resulted due to an experiment
- **getExperimentResult()** - a nullable experiment result `ExperimentResult<T>`, if the value resulted due to an experiment

As expected in Kotlin, you can access these getters using property accessors.
