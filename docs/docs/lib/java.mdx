# Java

This supports Java applications using Java version 1.8 and higher.

## Installation

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java)

### Gradle

To install in a Gradle project, add Jitpack to your repositories, and then add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies.

<CodeTabsAddDependencyPartial />

### Maven

To install in a Maven project, add Jitpack to your repositories:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Next, add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.growthbook</groupId>
    <artifactId>growthbook-sdk-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are 2 steps to initializing the GrowthBook SDK:

1. Create a GrowthBook context `GBContext` with the features JSON and the user attributes
2. Create the `GrowthBook` SDK class with the context

### GrowthBook context

The GrowthBook context `GBContext` can be created either by implementing the builder class, or by implementing the static method `create()`.

- the `featureJson` method takes a JSON string that is equivalent to the `features` property that is returned from the SDK Endpoint for the specified environment. You can find your endpoint on the [Settings &rarr; API Keys page <ExternalLink/>](https://app.growthbook.io/settings/keys).
- the `attributesJson` method takes a JSON string of the user attributes, e.g. `{ "id": 100, "country": "canada" }`

#### Using the Builder class

The builder is the easiest to use way to construct a `GBContext`, allowing you to provide as many or few arguments as you'd like:

<CodeTabsGBContextBuilderPartial />

#### Using the static create() method

You can also use the static method `create()` if you prefer, which will require you to pass all arguments. All arguments passed are available to be set using the builder above:

<CodeTabsGBContextStaticCreatePartial />

The implementation of this method actually uses [the builder mentioned above](#using-the-builder-class).
