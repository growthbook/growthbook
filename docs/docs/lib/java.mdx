:::success New

The GrowthBook Java SDK is a brand new feature. If you experience any issues, let us know either on [Slack](https://slack.growthbook.io/) or [create an issue](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/issues/new/choose).

:::

## Installation

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#growthbook/growthbook-sdk-java)

### Gradle

To install in a Gradle project, add Jitpack to your repositories, and then add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies.

<CodeTabsAddDependencyPartial />

### Maven

To install in a Maven project, add Jitpack to your repositories:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Next, add the dependency with the latest version to your project's dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.growthbook</groupId>
    <artifactId>growthbook-sdk-java</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

There are 2 steps to initializing the GrowthBook SDK:

1. Create a GrowthBook context `GBContext` with the features JSON and the user attributes
2. Create the `GrowthBook` SDK class with the context

### GrowthBook context

The GrowthBook context `GBContext` can be created either by implementing the builder class, available at `GBContext.builder()`, or by using the `GBContext` constructor.

| Field name            | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Using the GBContext builder

The builder is the easiest to use way to construct a `GBContext`, allowing you to provide as many or few arguments as you'd like. All fields mentioned above are available via the builder.

<CodeTabsGBContextBuilderPartial />

#### Using the GBContext constructor

You can also use `GBContext` constructor if you prefer, which will require you to pass all arguments explicitly.

<CodeTabsGBContextConstructorPartial />

For complete examples, see the [Examples](#code-examples) section below.

#### Features

The features JSON is equivalent to the `features` property that is returned from the SDK Endpoint for the specified environment. You can find your endpoint on the [Environments &rarr; SDK Endpoints page <ExternalLink/>](https://app.growthbook.io/environments).

- You can read more [about features here](/app/features)
- You can see an [example features JSON here](/app/api#the-sdk-endpoint)

#### Attributes

Attributes are a JSON string. You can specify attributes about the current user and request. Here's an example:

<CodeTabsUserAttributesPartial />

If you need to set or update attributes asynchronously, you can do so with `Context#attributesJson` or `GrowthBook#setAttributes`. This will completely overwrite the attributes object with whatever you pass in. Also, be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully.

#### Tracking Callback

Any time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, we may call this callback so you can record the assigned value in your event tracking or analytics system of choice.

**The tracking callback is only called when the user is in the experiment**. If they are not in the experiment, this will not be called. If you'd like to subscribe to all evaluations, regardless of experiment result, see [Subscribing to experiment runs](#subscribing-to-experiment-runs-with-the-experimentruncallback).

<CodeTabsTrackingCallbackPartial />

### Using Features

Every feature has a "value" which is assigned to a user. This value can be any JSON data type. If a feature doesn't exist, the value will be `null`.

There are 4 main methods for evaluating features.

| Method                        | Return type            | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`isOn(String)`**            | `Boolean`              | Returns true if the value is a truthy value                                                                               |
| **`isOff(String)`**           | `Boolean`              | Returns true if the value is a falsy value                                                                                |
| **`getFeatureValue(String)`** | generic `T` (nullable) | Returns the value cast to the generic type. Type is inferred based on the `defaultValue` argument provided.               |
| **`evalFeature(String)`**     | `FeatureResult<T>`     | Returns a feature result with a value of generic type `T`. The value type needs to be specified in the generic parameter. |

<CodeTabsUsingFeaturesPartial />

The `evalFeature` method returns a `FeatureResult<T>` object with more info about why the feature was assigned to the user. The `T` type corresponds to the value type of the feature. In the above example, `T` is `Float`.

`FeatureResult<T>` It has the following getters.

| Method                      | Return type                           | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`getValue()`**            | generic `T` (nullable)                | The evaluated value of the feature                                                           |
| **`getSource()`**           | `enum FeatureResultSource` (nullable) | The reason/source for the evaluated feature value.                                           |
| **`getRuleId()`**           | `String` (nullable)                   | ID of the rule that was used to assign the value to the user.                                |
| **`getExperiment()`**       | `Experiment<T>` (nullable)            | The experiment details, available only if the feature evaluates due to an experiment.        |
| **`getExperimentResult()`** | `ExperimentResult<T>` (nullable)      | The experiment result details, available only if the feature evaluates due to an experiment. |

As expected in Kotlin, you can access these getters using property accessors.

### Inline Experiments

Instead of declaring all features up-front in the context and referencing them by IDs in your code, you can also just run an experiment directly. This is done with the `growthbook.run(Experiment<T>)` method.

<CodeTabsRunExperimentPartial />

#### Inline experiment return value ExperimentResult

An `ExperimentResult<T>` is returned where `T` is the generic value type for the experiment.

There's also a number of methods available.

| Method                   | Return type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`getValue()`**         | generic `T` (nullable) | The evaluated value of the feature                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`getVariationId()`**   | `Integer` (nullable)   | Index of the variation used, if applicable                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`getInExperiment()`**  | `Boolean`              | If the user was in the experiment. This will be false if the user was excluded from being part of the experiment for any reason (e.g. failed targeting conditions).                                          |
| **`getHashAttribute()`** | `String`               | User attribute used for hashing, defaulting to `id` if not set.                                                                                                                                              |
| **`getHashValue()`**     | `String` (nullable)    | The hash value used for evaluating the experiment, if applicable.                                                                                                                                            |
| **`getFeatureId()`**     | `String`               | The feature key/ID                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`getHashUsed()`**      | `Boolean`              | If a hash was used to evaluate the experiment. This flag will only be true if the user was randomly assigned a variation. If the user was forced into a specific variation instead, this flag will be false. |

As expected in Kotlin, you can access these getters using property accessors.

### Subscribing to experiment runs with the ExperimentRunCallback

You can subscribe to experiment run evaluations using the `ExperimentRunCallback`.

<CodeTabsExperimentResultCallbackPartial />

Every time an experiment is evaluated when calling `growthBook.run(Experiment)`, the callbacks will be called.

You can subscribe with as many callbacks as you like:

<CodeTabsExperimentResultSubscribeMultipleCallbackPartial />

**The experiment run callback is called for every experiment run, regardless of experiment result**. If you would like to subscribe only to evaluations where the user falls into an experiment, see [TrackingCallback](#tracking-callback).
