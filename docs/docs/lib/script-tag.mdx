# HTML Script Tag SDK

We provide an HTML `<script>` tag option for easily integrating GrowthBook into any website.

This option is quick and straightforward to use and does not require coding knowledge to implement.

## Installation

For this, you will need a **Client Key** from an SDK Connection within GrowthBook. This will start with `sdk-`.

Add the following script tag to your website and replace `YOUR_CLIENT_KEY_HERE` with your actual Client Key:

```html
<script async
  data-client-key="YOUR_CLIENT_KEY_HERE"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@growthbook/growthbook/dist/bundles/auto.min.js"
></script>
```

For best performance, we recommend adding this script tag directly before the closing `</head>` tag, however it is also possible to load through something like Google Tag Manager if that is your only option.

### Optional Configuration Settings

Besides the Client Key, there are some additional settings you can define with `data-` attributes on the script tag:

- `data-api-host` - Defaults to GrowthBook Cloud's https://cdn.growthbook.io. This must be set to your own domain instead if self-hosting or using the GrowthBook Proxy.
- `data-decryption-key` - Required if you enabled encryption in your SDK Connection settings in GrowthBook

All other settings can be defined with a `window.growthbook_config` object BEFORE you load the script tag. This accepts the same settings as our [JavaScript SDK](/lib/js). Here's an example:

```html
<script>
window.growthbook_config = window.growthbook_config || {};
// Disable streaming updates
window.growthbook_config.backgroundSync = false;
</script>
```

If you need low level access to the GrowthBook SDK instance for any reason, you can use a callback function. This will be called as soon as the GrowthBook SDK instance is ready. If you push to the queue after GrowthBook has already loaded, the callback will be invoked immediately.

```html
<script>
window.growthbook_queue = window.growthbook_queue || [];
window.growthbook_queue.push((gb) => {
  // Do whatever you need with the GrowthBook instance here
  console.log(gb.getAttributes());
})
</script>
```

## Targeting Attributes

The following targeting attributes are set automatically and available for use.

- `id` - creates a long-lived `gbuuid` cookie if it doesn't exist already
- `url`
- `path`
- `host`
- `query`
- `pageTitle`
- `deviceType` - either `mobile` or `desktop`
- `browser` - one of `chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`, or `unknown`
- `utmSource`
- `utmMedium`
- `utmCampaign`
- `utmTerm`
- `utmContent`

In addition, if you use Google Tag Manager, any variables you set in your Data Layer will also be set here and available for targeting.

### Adding Custom Attributes

You can include your own custom attributes by adding the following BEFORE the GrowthBook snippet:

```html
<script>
window.growthbook_config = window.growthbook_config || {};
window.growthbook_config.attributes = {
    country: "US",
    otherCustomAttribute: 12,
}
</script>
```

You can also set custom attributes later, after the script tag has been added. Please note, this may cause flickering in your experiments if you reference these custom attributes in your experiment targeting.

```html
<script>
window.growthbook_queue = window.growthbook_queue || [];
window.growthbook_queue.push((gb) => {
  gb.updateAttributes({
    country: "US",
    otherCustomAttribute: 12,
  });
});
</script>
```

### Refreshing Auto Attributes

The GrowthBook snippet will automatically watch for URL changes and update attributes when that happens. If you would like more control over this behavior, you can manually trigger updates at any time by firing a `growthbookrefresh` event from JavaScript. For example:

```ts
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("growthbookrefresh"));
```

## Tracking Experiment Views

When a user views an experiment, a tracking event is fired. There is built-in support for Segment.io (`analytics.js`), GA4 (`gtag`), and Google Tag Manager (`dataLayer`).

### Segment.io

GrowthBook will automatically fire an event using `window.analytics.track` if it's present on the page. The event name is `Experiment Viewed` and it has two properties: `experiment_id` and `variation_id`.

There is no additional configuration needed.

### GA4 (`gtag`)

GrowthBook will automatically fire an event using Google Analytic 4's `window.gtag` if it's present on the page. The event name is `experiment_viewed` and it has two properties: `experiment_id` and `variation_id`.

There is no additional configuration needed.

### Google Tag Manager

We send the following event to the Data Layer. You will need to add a trigger based on this and forward it on to your analytics tool of choice.

```json
{
    "event": "experiment_viewed",
    "experiment_id": "...",
    "variation_id": "..."
}
```

We have a walkthrough tutorial on how to configure this in our [GTM Guide](/guide/google-tag-manager-and-growthbook#tracking-via-datalayer-and-gtm)

### Others

For any other event tracking system (or if the built-in ones above do not meet your requirements), you can define your own custom tracking callback function. This must be defined BEFORE loading the main GrowthBook snippet on the page.

```html
<script>
window.growthbook_config = window.growthbook_config || {};
window.growthbook_config.trackingCallback = (experiment, result) => {
  customEventTracker("Viewed Experiment", {
    experiment_id: experiment.key,
    variation_id: result.key
  })
};
</script>
```

## Using Feature Flags

You can use feature flags with this SDK, but it does require some manual coding work. Here is an example:

```html
<script>
// Wait for the GrowthBook SDK to load before running
window.growthbook_queue = window.growthbook_queue || [];
window.growthbook_queue.push((gb) => {
  // Function that uses feature flags to make changes to the page
  const applyFeatureFlags = () => {
    if(gb.isOn("dark-mode")) {
      document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
    } else {
      document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
    }
  }

  // Call your function initially plus whenever new data is received
  applyFeatureFlags();
  document.addEventListener("growthbookdata", applyFeatureFlags)
});
</script>
```

## Cookie Policy and GDPR

This SDK persists a random unique identifier in a first-party cookie named `gbuuid`. This cookie is required to provide a consistent user experience to your visitors. Without this cookie, if you run an A/B test, a visitor might be re-bucketed into a different variation every time they visit your website.

The `gbuuid` cookie does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (it's just a randomly generated id). It is a first-party cookie that is never shared with any third-party services, not even GrowthBook itself. However, we still recommend adding this to your site's cookie policy if you have one.
