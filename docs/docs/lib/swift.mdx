## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'GrowthBook-IOS'
end
```

Then, install:

```bash
pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add GrowthBook to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-swift.git")
]
```

## Quick Start

### 1) Configure

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your GrowthBook API host
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  // Your client key
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // Optional: encryption key if your features are encrypted
  encryptionKey: "abcdef98765",
  // Required user attributes for targeting (can be empty initially)
  attributes: [:],
  // Required: called whenever someone is put into an experiment
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiment exposures in your analytics
  },
  // Optional: real-time updates via SSE
  backgroundSync: false,
  // Optional: called when features are refreshed (SSE or manual refresh)
  refreshHandler: { success in
    // Update UI or trigger re-render if needed
  }
).initializer()
```

### 2) Set attributes

```swift
var attrs = [
  "id": "12345",         // stable user id for bucketing
  "deviceId": "abc123",  // fallback identifier if user id is unavailable
  "loggedIn": true,
  "country": "US"
]
gb.setAttributes(attrs)
```

### 3) Start feature flagging

```swift
if gb.isOn(feature: "feature-usage-code") {
  // Feature is enabled!
}

import Foundation // For JSON type
let value = gb.getFeatureValue(feature: "button-color", default: JSON("blue"))
```

### 4) Wait for features to load

- With background sync off, call `gb.refreshCache()` at app start or navigation points and show a loading state until complete.
- With background sync on, initial cache loads synchronously if present and updates stream in via SSE.
- Use `refreshHandler` to re-render when new features arrive.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiments
  },
  // Callback when features are refreshed
  refreshHandler: { success in
    if success {
      print("Features refreshed successfully")
    } else {
      print("Failed to refresh features")
    }
  },
  backgroundSync: true
).initializer()
```

## Loading Features

### Built-in fetching and refresh mechanisms

If you pass an `apiHost` and `clientKey` into `GrowthBookBuilder`, the SDK handles network requests, caching, retry/backoff, and decryption (when `encryptionKey` is provided). Use `gb.refreshCache()` to manually refresh on navigation or app resume.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in },
  // Optional: decrypt encrypted payloads
  encryptionKey: "abcdef98765",
  // Optional: real-time updates can be enabled later
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()

// Refresh on demand (e.g., app start or navigation)
_ = gb.refreshCache()
```

### Secure requests: custom HTTP headers

Add custom headers for API requests (e.g., auth tokens, custom user-agent). Provide default headers for the standard feature fetches and separate headers for SSE streaming if needed.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in }
)
  // Sent with feature fetch requests to the apiHost
  .setApiHostRequestHeaders([
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "X-App-Version": "1.2.3"
  ])
  // Sent with SSE connections to the streaming host
  .setStreamingHostRequestHeaders([
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
    "X-Device": "iPhone15,3"
  ])
  .initializer()
```

### Streaming updates (SSE)

Enable `backgroundSync: true` to receive real-time updates via SSE. The SDK reconnects automatically when network conditions change. Use `refreshHandler` to update UI when features change.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in },
  refreshHandler: { success in
    // Trigger UI updates when features change
  },
  backgroundSync: true
).initializer()
```

Monitor the SSE lifecycle using your app logs/telemetry. On transient network errors, the SDK will attempt automatic reconnects with backoff.

#### SSE resume support (Last-Event-Id)

When using `backgroundSync: true`, the SDK connects via SSE. To resume after interruptions without duplicating events, you can provide the last received event id so the server continues from that point.

```swift
// Persist and restore lastEventId yourself (e.g., UserDefaults) if you need fine-grained control
let lastEventId = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "gb_last_event_id")

var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in },
  backgroundSync: true
)
  .setStreamingHostRequestHeaders(["Last-Event-Id": lastEventId ?? ""]) // optional
  .initializer()

// Somewhere in your SSE handler, update lastEventId when new events arrive
// UserDefaults.standard.set(newEventId, forKey: "gb_last_event_id")
```

## Caching

The SDK persists downloaded feature payloads and related metadata to disk. By default, it will:

- Use a platform-specific system directory
  - iOS/watchOS/macOS: **Application Support** (`.applicationSupport`)
  - tvOS: **Caches** (`.caches`), since Application Support is not available on tvOS
- Create the cache folder automatically on first use
- Isolate data per `clientKey` by nesting under a client-specific subfolder
- Generate deterministic cache file names by hashing keys with **SHA256** and prefixing file names with the first 5 characters of the hash for readability

You can fully customize where and how the SDK caches data:

```swift
// Cache configuration
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(...)
  // Choose a system directory (defaults shown below)
  .setSystemCacheDirectory(
    // Default: .applicationSupport for iOS/watchOS/macOS; .caches for tvOS
    #if os(tvOS)
    .caches
    #else
    .applicationSupport
    #endif
  )
  // Or, provide an absolute custom path. The SDK will create it if missing.
  .setCustomCacheDirectory("/path/to/custom/cache")
  .initializer()

// Cache management
// Removes all on-disk cache for this SDK instance (scoped to the configured client key)
gb.clearCache()
```

:::note Cache management

- The cache directory will be created automatically if it does not exist.
- Cache file keys are SHA256-hashed with a 5-character prefix for human-friendly diagnostics while avoiding path-length and special-character issues.
- Multiple environments/apps can safely share the same parent directory; per-`clientKey` subfolders prevent collisions.

:::

#### Cache Key Hashing

The SDK uses **SHA-256** for generating deterministic cache file names:

- **Purpose**: Create unique, collision-resistant cache file identifiers
- **Format**: First 5 characters of SHA-256 hash for human-readable diagnostics
- **Isolation**: Per-client-key subfolders prevent cross-environment collisions

### Custom integration (local evaluation)

If you prefer to control network and caching yourself, pass features as a JSON `Data` blob into the builder. This enables fully local evaluation and works offline-first.

```swift
// Create JSON data for features
let featuresJSON = """
{
  "feature1": { "defaultValue": true }
}
"""
let featuresData = featuresJSON.data(using: .utf8)!

// Initialize with features data (local evaluation)
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  features: featuresData,
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in },
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()
```

## Remote evaluation vs. local evaluation

- Local evaluation loads a full feature payload into the SDK (e.g., via built-in fetching or a bundled JSON) and evaluates rules on-device.
- Remote evaluation delegates evaluation to GrowthBook and downloads already-evaluated feature values for the current attributes. This reduces payload size and can simplify privacy controls.
- Choose based on privacy, payload size, and offline requirements.

Local evaluation (bundled JSON):

```swift
let featuresJSON = """{ "feature1": { "defaultValue": true } }"""
let featuresData = featuresJSON.data(using: .utf8)!
let gbLocal = GrowthBookBuilder(
  features: featuresData,
  attributes: ["id": "12345"],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in }
).initializer()
```

Remote evaluation (standard fetching):

```swift
let gbRemote = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: ["id": "12345"],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in }
).initializer()
```

### Manual remote evaluation

If you use remote evaluation mode, you can trigger a re-fetch of evaluated payloads when user attributes or context change without waiting for the standard refresh cadence.

```swift
// When user attributes change significantly, trigger a remote eval refresh
gb.setAttributes(["id": "user_123", "plan": "pro"])
gb.refreshForRemoteEval()
```

#### Custom payload structure:

When using remote evaluation, ensure the attributes you send include all fields required by your targeting rules. You may also include metadata your edge or proxy expects (e.g., headers added via `setApiHostRequestHeaders`).

```swift
// Attributes control what the remote evaluator returns
gb.setAttributes([
  "id": "user_123",
  "country": "US",
  "appVersion": "1.3.0",
  "plan": "pro"
])

// Then manually trigger remote evaluation
gb.refreshForRemoteEval()
```

## Encrypted features

The Swift SDK uses **AES-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard - Cipher Block Chaining)** encryption for securing feature payloads:

- **Algorithm**: AES-CBC with 128-bit key length
- **Key Format**: Base64-encoded encryption key
- **IV (Initialization Vector)**: 16-byte random IV generated for each encryption operation
- **Payload Format**: `{base64_iv}.{base64_encrypted_data}`

GrowthBook uses **Server-Side Encryption** to encrypt feature payloads using AES-CBC before transmission. The Swift SDK automatically decrypts payloads when the `encryptionKey` is provided in the initialization. See below example:

```swift
let gbEncrypted = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  encryptionKey: "abcdef98765",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in }
).initializer()
```

Decrypted features are cached **securely** on the device. If decryption fails, the SDK gracefully falls back to default feature values.

:::warning Security Considerations
While encryption adds a layer of security, remember that:

- The decryption key is accessible within the client-side application
- For highly sensitive information, consider using [Remote Evaluation](#remote-evaluation-vs-local-evaluation) instead
- Encryption keys should be managed securely and rotated regularly
  :::

## Sticky bucketing

Sticky bucketing ensures that once a user is assigned to a variation in an experiment or feature rule configured as “Sticky,” they will continue to see the same variation on subsequent evaluations. Read more about [Sticky bucketing Feature](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/sticky-bucketing)

How to enable:

- In GrowthBook, enable Sticky bucketing on the experiment or on the feature rule.
- In the SDK, provide a stable identity attribute (commonly `id`). If no `id` is available (e.g., logged out), use a device-scoped fallback such as `deviceId` until login.

By default, when a sticky rule runs the SDK will:

- Look up an existing sticky assignment for the current identity key
- If found, return the same variation without re-assigning
- If not found, evaluate the rule normally, persist the chosen variation locally, and return it
- Persist across app restarts and feature refreshes; changing non-identity attributes (e.g., `country`) will not change the sticky result. Changing the identity (e.g., user logs in/out) causes a lookup under the new identity key

```swift
gb.setAttributes([
  "id": "user_123",        // stable across sessions
  "deviceId": "abcd-efgh"  // fallback when logged out
])
```

### Custom Sticky Bucket Service with custom storage

Use this to control how and where sticky assignments are persisted. Provide a prefix to namespace data (e.g., by app or environment) and a storage backend that implements simple key/value get-set-delete semantics (e.g., `UserDefaults`, Keychain, SQLite, or your own cache layer). If not provided, the SDK uses its built-in persistent storage to remember sticky assignments.

```swift
// Custom Sticky Bucket Service with custom storage
let customStorage = MyCachingManager()
let stickyService = StickyBucketService(
  prefix: "myapp_sticky_",
  localStorage: customStorage
)

var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(...)
  .setStickyBucketService(stickyBucketService: stickyService)
  .initializer()
```

Tips:

- Use a unique `prefix` per environment (e.g., `prod_`, `staging_`) to avoid cross-environment bleed.
- To “forget” a user’s sticky assignment on logout, either switch the identity you send in `attributes` (e.g., from `id` to `deviceId`) or clear the underlying storage used by your sticky service.

## Prerequisites

Flags can depend on other flags via prerequisites. If a prerequisite is not met, the dependent flag will resolve to its fallback value. Ensure attributes satisfy prerequisite rules before evaluating. Read more about [Prerequisite features](https://docs.growthbook.io/features/prerequisites)

```swift
let enabled = gb.isOn(feature: "child-feature")
```

## SemVer targeting

Map your app version/build into attributes and target with semver rules (e.g., rollouts to ">=1.2.0").

```swift
import Foundation

let appVersion = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["CFBundleShortVersionString"] as? String ?? ""
var attrs = gb.getAttributes()
attrs["appVersion"] = appVersion
gb.setAttributes(attrs)
```

## v2 hashing

The SDK supports v2 hashing for cross-SDK parity and consistent bucketing. When migrating, verify exposure stability during QA across platforms.

### Hashing Algorithms

The Swift SDK implements sophisticated hashing algorithms for consistent user bucketing and secure attribute handling:

#### FNV32a Hashing (Fowler-Noll-Vo)

The SDK uses the **FNV32a** algorithm for user bucketing and experiment assignment:

- **Algorithm**: Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function (fnv32a variant)
- **Purpose**: Consistent user bucketing across all SDK platforms
- **Output**: 32-bit unsigned integer converted to float between 0 and 1
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensures identical bucketing behavior across iOS, Android, Web, and server-side SDKs

#### Hash Version 2 (Recommended)

The SDK supports **v2 hashing** which fixes bias issues present in the original algorithm:

```swift
// v2 hashing formula (unbiased)
n = fnv32a(fnv32a(seed + value) + "")
return (n % 10000) / 10000
```

:::info V2 Hashing

V2 Hashing is:

- **Unbiased**: Eliminates parallel experiment bias.
- **Higher Precision**: Uses 10,000 buckets instead of 1,000
- **Consistent**: Identical behavior across all GrowthBook SDKs

:::

## Experimentation and tracking

Set `trackingCallback` to capture exposures whenever a user is assigned to a variation. Send these to your analytics provider. The callback provides `experiment.key` and `experimentResult.variationId`.

#### Generic example:

```swift
let gbTracking = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    print("Viewed Experiment", experiment.key, "variation:", result.variationId)
  }
).initializer()
```

#### Firebase Analytics example:

```swift
import FirebaseAnalytics

let gbFirebase = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    Analytics.logEvent("gb_exposure", parameters: [
      "experiment_key": experiment.key,
      "variation_id": result.variationId
    ])
  }
).initializer()
```

### Experiment Result subscriptions

Subscribe to the experiments to receive callbacks for every experiment run.

```swift
// Subscribe to experiment results
gb.subscribe { experiment, result in
  print("Experiment: \(experiment.key), Variation: \(result.variationId)")
}

// Clear all subscriptions when done
gb.clearSubscriptions()
```

## Security Features

The Swift SDK implements comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure secure feature flag evaluation:

### Secure Attributes

When **secure attribute hashing** is enabled in your SDK Connection, you must manually hash sensitive attributes before passing them to the SDK. This allows you to safely target users based on sensitive data without exposing it to the client.

- **Manual Hashing Required**: You must hash `secureString` or `secureString[]` attributes using SHA-256
- **Salt Protection**: Use your organization's secure attribute salt for additional security
- **Privacy Compliance**: Enables targeting based on sensitive data without exposing it to the client
- **GDPR/CCPA Ready**: Helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations
- **Format**: `SHA256(attribute_value + organization_salt)`
- **Implementation**: Use Apple's CryptoKit framework for SHA-256 hashing

```swift
import CryptoKit

// Helper function to hash secure attributes
func hashSecureAttribute(_ value: String, salt: String) -> String {
    let data = (value + salt).data(using: .utf8)!
    let hash = SHA256.hash(data: data)
    return hash.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
}

// Your organization's secure attribute salt (set in Organization Settings)
let salt = "your_organization_salt"

// Hash sensitive attributes before passing to SDK
let email = "user@example.com"
let phone = "+1234567890"

gb.setAttributes([
  "id": "user_123",
  "email": hashSecureAttribute(email, salt: salt),  // Must be manually hashed
  "phone": hashSecureAttribute(phone, salt: salt),  // Must be manually hashed
  "country": "US"  // Regular attribute, not hashed
])
```

:::note Secure attribute hashing
**Important**: When secure attribute hashing is enabled, all targeting conditions in the SDK payload referencing attributes with datatype `secureString` or `secureString[]` will be anonymized via SHA-256 hashing. You must manually hash these attributes using your organization's secure attribute salt.
:::

### Remote Evaluation Security

For maximum security, use **Remote Evaluation** mode:

- **Server-Side Processing**: Feature evaluation happens on your secure servers
- **No Client Exposure**: Targeting rules and unused variations never reach the client
- **Minimal Payload**: Only evaluated results are transmitted
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Sensitive business logic remains server-side

```swift
// Remote evaluation for maximum security
let gbSecure = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: ["id": "user_123"],
  trackingCallback: { _, _ in },
  remoteEval: true  // Enable remote evaluation
).initializer()
```

## Troubleshooting and debugging

- Comprehensive logging
  - Set your app/logger to debug or trace during integration to observe evaluation decisions, cache reads/writes, and SSE state changes.
    - Log levels: `.debug`, `.info`, `.warning`, `.error` are supported and use `setLogLevel()` to configure the level.
  - Built-in OS logging integration (uses `os.Logger` on iOS 14+ and `OSLog` on older versions)
  - QA Mode (`setQAMode()`) functionality and use cases
  - Be mindful to disable verbose logs in production.
- Network errors
  - The SDK retries transient failures with backoff when fetching or streaming. Inspect your networking layer logs and verify headers/hosts.
  - Confirm that custom headers are accepted by your proxy/CDN and not stripped.
- SSE connection status monitoring
  - Use your own telemetry around `refreshHandler` or UI updates to infer connectivity. Consider persisting the last event id to resume streams as shown above.

```swift
// Example: simple log wrapper
func log(_ message: String) {
  #if DEBUG
  print("[GrowthBook] \(message)")
  #endif
}
```
