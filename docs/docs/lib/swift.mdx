# Swift (iOS)

This SDK supports the following platforms and versions:

- iOS 12 and above
- Apple TvOS 12 and above
- Apple WatchOS 5.0 and above

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'GrowthBook-IOS'
end
```

Then, install:

```bash
pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add GrowthBook to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-swift.git")
]
```

## Quick Usage

```swift
// First, create a GrowthBook instance using your unique features endpoint
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your GrowthBook feature flag endpoint
  url: "https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/sdk-abc123"
).initializer()

// Then, add targeting attributes so you can control the release of your features
// TODO: Replace with your real targeting attributes
var attrs = [
  "id": "12345",
  "deviceId": "abc123",
  "loggedIn": true,
  "country": "US"
]
gb.setAttributes(attrs)

// Finally, start feature flagging!

// Boolean (On/Off) Feature Flag
if (gb.isOn("feature-usage-code")) {
  // Feature is enabled!
}

// String/Number/JSON Feature Flag with a fallback
var value = gb.getFeatureValue("button-color", "blue")
print(value)
```

## Loading Features

In order for the GrowthBook SDK to work, it needs to have feature definitions from the GrowthBook API. There are 2 ways to get this data into the SDK.

### Built-in Fetching and Caching

If you pass a `url` into GrowthBookBuilder, it will handle the network requests, caching, retry logic, etc. for you automatically. If your feature payload is encrypted, you can also pass in an `encryptionKey` and it will decrypt feature flags automatically.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your feature flag endpoint
  url: "https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/sdk-abc123",
  // View your encryption key on the Features -> SDKs page
  encryptionKey: "abcdef98765"
).initializer()
```

If you want to refresh the features at any time (e.g. when a navigation event occurs), you can call `gb.refreshCache()`.

### Custom Integration

If you prefer to handle the network and caching logic yourself, you can instead pass in a features JSON object directly. For example, you might store features in Postgres on your back-end and send it down to your app as part of an initial bootstrap API call.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  features: [
    "feature1": Feature(defaultValue: true)
  ]
).initializer()
```

## Experimentation (A/B Testing)

In order to run A/B tests on your feature flags, you need to set up a tracking callback function. This is called every time a user is put into an experiment and can be used to track the exposure event in your analytics system (Segment, Mixpanel, GA, etc.).

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your feature flag endpoint
  url: "https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/sdk-abc123",
  // Called whenever someone is put into an experiment
  trackingCallback: { experiment, experimentResult in
    // TODO: Track in your real analytics system
    print("Viewed Experiment")
    print("Experiment Id: ", experiment.key)
    print("Variation Id: ", experimentResult.variationId)
  }
).initializer()
```
