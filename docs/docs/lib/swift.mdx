# Swift (iOS)

This SDK supports the following platforms and versions:

- iOS 12 and above
- Apple TvOS 12 and above
- Apple WatchOS 5.0 and above

<SdkResources sdk="swift" />

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'GrowthBook-IOS'
end
```

Then, install:

```bash
pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Add GrowthBook to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-swift.git")
]
```

## Quick Usage

```swift
// First, create a GrowthBook instance using your unique API host and client key
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your GrowthBook API host
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  // Your client key
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // User attributes for targeting
  attributes: [:],
  // Tracking callback for experiments
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiment exposures
  },
  // Enable/disable background sync for real-time updates
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()

// Then, add targeting attributes so you can control the release of your features
var attrs = [
  "id": "12345",
  "deviceId": "abc123",
  "loggedIn": true,
  "country": "US"
]
gb.setAttributes(attrs)

// Finally, start feature flagging!

// Boolean (On/Off) Feature Flag
if gb.isOn(feature: "feature-usage-code") {
  // Feature is enabled!
}

// String/Number/JSON Feature Flag with a fallback
import Foundation // For JSON type
var value = gb.getFeatureValue(feature: "button-color", default: JSON("blue"))
print(value)
```

## Loading Features

In order for the GrowthBook SDK to work, it needs to have feature definitions from the GrowthBook API. There are 2 ways to get this data into the SDK.

### Built-in Fetching and Caching

If you pass an `apiHost` and `clientKey` into GrowthBookBuilder, it will handle the network requests, caching, retry logic, etc. for you automatically. If your feature payload is encrypted, you can also pass in an `encryptionKey` and it will decrypt feature flags automatically.

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your GrowthBook API host
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  // Your client key
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // Encryption key if your features are encrypted
  encryptionKey: "abcdef98765",
  // Required user attributes for targeting (can be empty initially)
  attributes: [:],
  // Required tracking callback for experiments
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiments
  },
  // Enable/disable background sync with SSE
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()
```

If you want to refresh the features at any time (e.g. when a navigation event occurs), you can call `gb.refreshCache()`.

### Custom Integration

If you prefer to handle the network and caching logic yourself, you can instead pass in a features JSON object directly. For example, you might store features in Postgres on your back-end and send it down to your app as part of an initial bootstrap API call.

```swift
// Create JSON data for features
let featuresJSON = """
{
  "feature1": {
    "defaultValue": true
  }
}
"""
let featuresData = featuresJSON.data(using: .utf8)!

// Initialize with features data
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your feature definitions as Data object
  features: featuresData,
  // Required user attributes for targeting (can be empty initially)
  attributes: [:],
  // Required tracking callback for experiments
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiments
  },
  // Enable/disable background sync
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()
```

## Experimentation (A/B Testing)

In order to run A/B tests on your feature flags, you need to set up a tracking callback function. This is called every time a user is put into an experiment and can be used to track the exposure event in your analytics system (Segment, Mixpanel, GA, etc.).

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  // Your GrowthBook API host
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  // Your client key
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // Required user attributes for targeting (can be empty initially)
  attributes: [:],
  // Called whenever someone is put into an experiment
  trackingCallback: { experiment, experimentResult in
    // TODO: Track in your real analytics system
    print("Viewed Experiment")
    print("Experiment Id: ", experiment.key)
    print("Variation Id: ", experimentResult.variationId)
  },
  // Enable/disable background sync
  backgroundSync: false
).initializer()
```

## Background Sync

The Swift SDK supports real-time feature flag updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This is controlled through the `backgroundSync` parameter when initializing the SDK.

When `backgroundSync` is set to `true`, the SDK will establish an SSE connection to receive real-time updates whenever your feature flags change. This eliminates the need to manually refresh the cache.

When `backgroundSync` is set to `false`, you'll need to call `gb.refreshCache()` manually whenever you want to fetch the latest feature flags.

### Refresh Handler

You can set a refresh handler to be notified when features are updated, either through background sync or manual refresh:

```swift
var gb: GrowthBookSDK = GrowthBookBuilder(
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  attributes: [:],
  trackingCallback: { experiment, result in
    // Track experiments
  },
  // Callback when features are refreshed
  refreshHandler: { success in
    if success {
      print("Features refreshed successfully")
    } else {
      print("Failed to refresh features")
    }
  },
  backgroundSync: true
).initializer()
```
