# GrowthBook Go SDK

<SdkResources sdk="go" />

## Requirements

- Go version 1.21 or higher (tested with 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23)

## Installation

```
go get github.com/growthbook/growthbook-golang
```

## Quick Usage

```go
import (
    "context"
    "log"
    gb "github.com/growthbook/growthbook-golang"
)

// Create a new client instance with a client key and a data source that loads features
// in the background using an SSE stream. Pass the client's options to the NewClient function.
client, err := gb.NewClient(
    context.Background(),
    gb.WithClientKey("sdk-XXXX"),
    gb.WithSseDataSource(),
)
defer client.Close()

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Client initialization failed: ", err)
}

// The data source starts asynchronously. Use EnsureLoaded to wait until the client data
// is initialized for the first time.
if err := client.EnsureLoaded(context.Background()); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Data loading failed: ", err)
}

// Create a child client with specific attributes.
attrs := gb.Attributes{"id": 100, "user": "user1"}
child, err := client.WithAttributes(attrs)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Child client creation failed: ", err)
}

// Evaluate a text feature.
buttonColor := child.EvalFeature(context.Background(), "buy-button-color")
if buttonColor.Value == "blue" {
    // Perform actions for blue button.
}

// Evaluate a boolean feature.
darkMode := child.EvalFeature(context.Background(), "dark-mode")
if darkMode.On {
    // Enable dark mode.
}
```

### Client

The client is the core component of the GrowthBook SDK. After installing and importing the SDK, create a single shared instance of `growthbook.Client` using the `growthbook.NewClient` function with a list of options. You can customize the client with options such as a custom logger, client key, decryption key, default attributes, or a feature list loaded from JSON. The client is thread-safe and can be safely used from multiple goroutines.

While you can evaluate features directly using the main client instance, it's recommended to create child client instances that include session- or query-specific data. To create a child client with local attributes, call `client.WithAttributes`:

```go
attrs := gb.Attributes{"id": 100, "user": "Bob"}
child, err := client.WithAttributes(attrs)
```

You can then evaluate features using the child client:

```go
res := child.EvalFeature(context.Background(), "main-button-color")
```

Additional options, such as `WithLogger`, `WithUrl`, and `WithAttributesOverrides`, can also be used to customize child clients. Since child clients share data with the main client instance, they will automatically receive feature updates.

To stop background updates, call `client.Close()` on the main client instance when it is no longer needed.

#### Additional options for sticky bucketing:

- `WithStickyBucketService`: Provides a service implementation for storing and retrieving sticky bucket assignments
- `WithStickyBucketAttributes`: Sets specific attributes to use for sticky bucketing (if different from regular attributes)

```go
// Configure a client with sticky bucketing
client, err := gb.NewClient(
    context.Background(),
    gb.WithClientKey("sdk-XXXX"),
    gb.WithStickyBucketService(NewInMemoryStickyBucketService()),
)
```

## Loading Features and Experiments

For the GrowthBook SDK to function, it requires feature and experiment definitions from the GrowthBook API. There are several ways to provide this data to the SDK.

### Built-in Fetching and Caching

If you pass `WithClientKey` and one of the options `WithSseDataSource` or `WithPollDatasource(period)` when calling `gb.NewClient`, it will load feature definitions from the GrowthBook site and update them periodically—either using SSE (server-sent events) or polling. You can also provide the `WithApiHost` and `WithDecryptionKey` options if needed.

The loading of features is an asynchronous process so that your app is not blocked while waiting, and it can continue its initialization. If you need to ensure that the definitions are loaded, use the `client.EnsureLoaded` call. This will block until the loading process finishes and will return an error if any failures occur. `EnsureLoaded` is thread-safe and can be called from multiple goroutines simultaneously. Both `NewClient` and `EnsureLoaded` respect the contexts passed to them.

The features cache is shared among all child client instances created via `client.WithXXX` calls.

### Custom Integration

Feature definitions are stored in the client's shared data. Normally, the data source will download them from the GrowthBook site, but you can provide an initial set during the `NewClient` call using the `WithFeatures`, `WithJsonFeatures`, or `WithEncryptedJsonFeature` options. It is also possible to update the shared feature definitions using the `SetXXXFeatures` client methods.

If you have obtained a GrowthBook API response in JSON, you can update the client's state with the `client.UpdateFromApiResponseJSON` call.

### Attributes

You can specify attributes about the current user and request. These attributes are used for the following purposes:

- Feature targeting (for example, paid users receive one value, while free users receive another).
- Assigning persistent variations in A/B tests (for example, a user with id "123" always gets variation B).

Attributes can be any JSON data type—boolean, float, string, array, or object—and are represented by the `Attributes` type, which is an alias for Go's generic `map[string]interface{}` type used for JSON objects. If you know the attributes upfront, you can pass them into `NewClient` using the `WithAttributes` option:

```go
attrs := gb.Attributes{
    "id":       "123",
    "loggedIn": true,
    "deviceId": "abc123def456",
    "company":  "acme",
    "paid":     false,
    "url":      "/pricing",
    "browser":  "chrome",
    "mobile":   false,
    "country":  "US",
}

client, err := gb.NewClient(context.Background(),
    gb.WithAttributes(attrs),
)
```

You can also create a child client instance with updated attributes using the `WithAttributes` method:

```go
attrs := gb.Attributes{
  "id": "100",
  "mobile": true,
}

client, err := client.WithAttributes(attrs)
```

This will completely overwrite the existing attributes object with the values you provide. If you want to merge the new attributes with the existing ones instead, you can use the `WithAttributeOverrides` method:

```go
client, err := client.WithAttributeOverrides(attrs)
```

This method updates only the fields provided in `attrs`, keeping the other fields from the original client instance.

Be aware that changing attributes may change the assigned feature values. This can be disorienting to users if not handled carefully. A common approach is to refresh attributes only on navigation, when the window is focused, or after a user performs a major action such as logging in.

#### Secure Attributes

When _secure attribute hashing_ is enabled, all targeting conditions in the SDK payload referencing attributes with datatype `secureString` or `secureString[]` will be anonymized via SHA-256 hashing. This allows you to safely target users based on sensitive attributes. You must enable this feature in your SDK Connection for it to take effect.

If your SDK Connection has secure attribute hashing enabled, you will need to manually hash any `secureString` or `secureString[]` attributes that you pass into the GrowthBook SDK.

To hash an attribute, use Go's `crypto/sha256` package to compute the SHA-256 hashed value of your attribute _plus_ your organization's secure attribute salt.

```go
import (
    "crypto/sha256"
    "encoding/hex"
    gb "github.com/growthbook/growthbook-golang"
)

// Your secure attribute salt (set in Organization Settings)
salt := "f09jq3fij"

// Hashing a secureString attribute
userEmail := user.Email
hasher := sha256.New()
hasher.Write([]byte(salt + userEmail))
hashedEmail := hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil))

// Hashing a secureString[] attribute
userTags := user.Tags
hashedTags := make([]string, len(userTags))
for i, tag := range userTags {
    hasher := sha256.New()
    hasher.Write([]byte(salt + tag))
    hashedTags[i] = hex.EncodeToString(hasher.Sum(nil))
}

// Create attributes with hashed values
attrs := gb.Attributes{
    "id":       user.ID,
    "loggedIn": true,
    "email":    hashedEmail,
    "tags":     hashedTags,
}

// Create a client with the hashed attributes
client, err := client.WithAttributes(attrs)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Tracking Callback

Whenever an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, you can run a callback function to record the assigned value in your event tracking or analytics system.

You can set up two callbacks to track experiment results and feature usage:

1. **ExperimentCallback**: Triggered when a user is included in an experiment.
2. **FeatureUsageCallback**: Triggered on each feature evaluation.

Additionally, you can attach extra data that will be sent with each callback. These callbacks can be set globally via the `NewClient` function using the `WithExperimentCallback` and `WithFeatureUsageCallback` options. Alternatively, you can set them locally when creating child clients using similar methods (for example, `client.WithExperimentCallback`). Extra data is set via the `WithExtraData` option.

```go
cb := func(ctx context.Context, exp *Experiment, result *ExperimentResult, extra any) {
    user, ok := extra.(User)
    if !ok {
        return
    }

    // Example using Segment.io
    segment.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
        UserId: user.id,
        Event:  "Experiment Viewed",
        Properties: analytics.NewProperties().
            Set("experimentId", exp.Key).
            Set("variationId", result.VariationID),
    })
}

client := gb.NewClient(ctx, gb.WithExperimentCallback(cb), /* other options */)
```

### Feature Usage Callback

GrowthBook can fire a callback whenever a feature is evaluated for a user. This is useful for updating third-party tools such as New Relic or DataDog.

Like the tracking callback, this can be defined on either the global GrowthBook client instance or as part of a child client. It also receives the context and any extra data as parameters.

```go
cb := func(ctx context.Context, featureKey string, result *FeatureResult, extra any) {
    user, ok := extra.(User)
    if !ok {
        return
    }

    log.Println("Feature:", featureKey, "Result:", result.Value, "user_id:", user.id)
}

client := gb.NewClient(ctx, gb.WithFeatureUsageCallback(cb), /* other options */)
```

The `result` argument is the same as what is returned from `EvalFeature`.

### Sticky Bucketing

Sticky Bucketing ensures users see consistent experiment variations across sessions and devices. This is particularly useful when:

- You need to slow down experiment enrollment without affecting existing users
- You want to fix bugs in an experiment without including users who saw the buggy version
- You need consistent experiences across different devices or sessions

#### Implementation

The SDK provides a built-in thread-safe in-memory implementation that you can use right away:

```go
// Create an in-memory sticky bucket service
service := gb.NewInMemoryStickyBucketService()

// Create a client with sticky bucketing
client, err := gb.NewClient(
    context.Background(),
    gb.WithClientKey("sdk-XXXX"),
    gb.WithStickyBucketService(service),
)
```

To use sticky bucketing in an experiment, set the `BucketVersion` and optionally `MinBucketVersion` properties:

```go
exp := &gb.Experiment{
    Key:             "my-experiment",
    Variations:      []gb.FeatureValue{"control", "treatment"},
    Meta: []gb.VariationMeta{
        {Key: "0"}, // Use numeric keys to match variation IDs
        {Key: "1"},
    },
    BucketVersion:    1,       // Current version of the experiment
    MinBucketVersion: 0,       // Minimum version users must have seen
    HashAttribute:    "userId", // Primary attribute for bucketing
    FallbackAttribute: "deviceId", // Used when primary is missing
}

result := client.RunExperiment(context.Background(), exp)
```

#### Custom Storage Implementation

Implement your own persistent storage by implementing the `StickyBucketService` interface:

```go
type StickyBucketService interface {
    GetAssignments(attributeName string, attributeValue string) (*StickyBucketAssignmentDoc, error)
    SaveAssignments(doc *StickyBucketAssignmentDoc) error
    GetAllAssignments(attributes map[string]string) (StickyBucketAssignments, error)
}
```

#### Key Features

1. **Version Control**:

   - `BucketVersion`: Controls which version of the experiment a user is assigned to
   - `MinBucketVersion`: Blocks users from versions below this number

2. **Attribute-Based Bucketing**:

   - `HashAttribute`: Primary attribute for bucketing (usually userId)
   - `FallbackAttribute`: Secondary attribute when primary is missing

3. **Thread Safety**:
   - The in-memory implementation uses `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent access
   - Caching reduces database/service calls in high-traffic environments

#### Experiment Result Changes

The `ExperimentResult` returned by `RunExperiment` now includes a `StickyBucketUsed` boolean field that indicates if the variation was assigned from a sticky bucket:

```go
result := client.RunExperiment(context.Background(), experiment)
if result.StickyBucketUsed {
    // The user was assigned based on a previously stored assignment
}
```

### Using Features

The primary method, `client.EvalFeature(ctx, key)`, accepts a feature key and uses the stored feature definitions and attributes to evaluate the feature value. It returns a `FeatureResult` value that includes detailed information about why the value was assigned to the user:

- `Value`: The JSON value of the feature (or `nil` if not defined), represented as a `FeatureValue` (an alias for `interface{}`, using Go's default behavior for JSON).
- `On` and `Off`: The JSON value cast as booleans (to make your code easier to read).
- `Source`: A value of type `FeatureResultSource` that explains why the value was assigned to the user. Possible values include `UnknownFeatureResultSource`, `DefaultValueResultSource`, `ForceResultSource`, or `ExperimentResultSource`.
- `Experiment`: Information about the experiment (if any) used to assign the value.
- `ExperimentResult`: The result of the experiment (if any) that determined the value.

Here's an example that uses all of these fields:

```go
result, err := client.EvalFeature(context.TODO(), "my-feature")
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error
}

// The JSON value (which may be null, a string, boolean, number, array, or object).
fmt.Println(result.Value)

if result.On {
    // The feature value is truthy (in a JavaScript sense).
}
if result.Off {
    // The feature value is falsy.
}

// If the feature value was assigned as part of an experiment:
if result.Source == gb.ExperimentResultSource {
    // Get all the possible variations that could have been assigned.
    fmt.Println(result.Experiment.Variations)
}
```

## Inline Experiments

Experiments can be defined and run using the `Experiment` type and the `RunExperiment` method of the client. Experiment definitions can be created directly as values of the `Experiment` type, or parsed from JSON using Go's `json.Unmarshal` function. Passing an `Experiment` value to the `RunExperiment` method will run the experiment and return an `ExperimentResult` that contains the resulting feature value. This approach allows users to run arbitrary experiments without providing feature definitions upfront.

```go
experiment := &gb.Experiment{
    Key: "my-experiment",
    Variations: []gb.FeatureValue{"red", "blue", "green"},
}

result := client.RunExperiment(context.TODO(), experiment)
```

A full list of experiment fields can be found in the [documentation <ExternalLink/>](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/growthbook/growthbook-golang#Experiment).

When defining experiments, you can now use additional parameters for sticky bucketing:

```go
experiment := &gb.Experiment{
    Key: "my-experiment",
    Variations: []gb.FeatureValue{"red", "blue", "green"},
    // Sticky bucket parameters
    BucketVersion: 1,
    MinBucketVersion: 0,
    HashAttribute: "userId",
    FallbackAttribute: "deviceId",
}
```

### Inline Experiment Return Value

A call to `RunExperiment` returns a value of type `*ExperimentResult`:

```go
result := client.RunExperiment(context.TODO(), experiment)

// Whether the user is part of the experiment.
fmt.Println(result.InExperiment) // true or false

// The index of the assigned variation.
fmt.Println(result.VariationId) // 0 or 1

// The value of the assigned variation.
fmt.Println(result.Value) // "A" or "B"

// The user attribute used to assign a variation.
fmt.Println(result.HashAttribute) // "id"

// The value of that attribute.
fmt.Println(result.HashValue) // e.g., "123"

// Whether a sticky bucket assignment was used
fmt.Println(result.StickyBucketUsed) // true or false
```

The `InExperiment` flag is set to true only if the user was randomly assigned a variation. If the user fails any targeting rules or is forced into a specific variation, this flag will be false.

## Logging

The SDK uses the `slog` logger instance. You can set up your own logger using the `WithLogger` option when calling the `NewClient` function. It is also possible to create a child GrowthBook client with its own logger, parameterized with additional data, as shown below:

```go
func main() {
    client, err := gb.NewClient(/* options */)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // ...
}

func handleRequest(ctx context.Context, client *gb.Client, r request) {
    traceId := ctx.Value("traceId")
    logger := slog.Default().With("traceId", traceId)
    client, err := client.WithLogger(logger)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    client, err = client.WithAttributes(gb.Attributes{"user_id": r.user_id})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Now, all calls to the client will use the local logger and attributes.
}
```
