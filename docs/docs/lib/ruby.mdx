## Requirements

The Ruby SDK requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher.

## Installation

Install the gem:

```
gem install growthbook
```

## Quick start

```ruby
require 'growthbook'

# Fetch features from a GrowthBook instance
# You should cache this in Redis or similar in production
features_repository = Growthbook::FeatureRepository.new(
  endpoint: 'https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/MY_API_KEY',
  decryption_key: nil
)
features = features_repository.fetch

# Create a context for the current user/request
gb = Growthbook::Context.new(
  features: features,
  # User attributes for targeting / variation assignment
  attributes: {
    id: '123',
    country: 'US'
  }
)

# Use a boolean feature flag
if gb.on? :my_feature_key
  puts 'My feature is on!'
end

# Get the value of a multivariate feature with a fallback
btn_color = gb.feature_value(:signup_btn_color, 'pink')
```

## Track experiment impressions

When a feature's value is determined by an experiment (A/B test), you typically want to track that assignment event for later analysis.

There are two ways to do this. First is by accessing all impressions at the end of a request:

```ruby
gb.impressions.each do |key, result|
  puts "Assigned variation #{result.variation_id} in experiment #{key}"
end
```

Second is by using a listener to get alerted in realtime as users are put into experiments:

```ruby
class MyImpressionListener
  def on_experiment_viewed(experiment, result)
    puts "Assigned variation #{result.variation_id} in experiment #{experiment.key}"
  end
end

gb.listener = MyImpressionListener.new
```

## Using with Rails

The recommended way to use GrowthBook with a Rails app is as follows:

1. Fetch the features from the GrowthBook API (or a cache) once at server startup
2. At the start of each request, create a new Context object
3. Use the Context object to evaluate features and run experiments during the request
4. At the end of a request, track experiment impressions (if any) and destroy the Context instance
5. (optional) Periodically refresh the list of features from the GrowthBook API in the background

## Dev and QA helpers

For dev/QA it's often useful to force specific feature values.

```ruby
# These take precedence over everything else when determining a feature's value
gb.forced_features = {
  my_feature: true,
  other_feature: "new value"
}

# Will always be true
gb.is_on?(:my_feature)

# Will always be "new value"
gb.feature_value(:other_feature)
```

For more predictability during QA, you can also globally disable all random assignment in experiments from running:

```ruby
gb.enabled = false
```

## Inline experiments

It's also possible to directly run an experiment directly in code without going through a feature flag.

```ruby
# Simple 50/50 experiment
result = gb.run(Growthbook::InlineExperiment.new(
  key: "my-experiment-key",
  variations: ["red", "green"]
))

# Whether or not the user was included in the experiment (either true or false)
puts(result.in_experiment ? 'included' : 'excluded')

# The value of the assigned variation (either "red" or "green")
puts(result.value)

# The variation index (either 0 or 1)
puts(result.variation_id)
```

There are lots of additional options when running inline experiments:

```ruby
gb.run(Growthbook::InlineExperiment.new(
  key: "my-experiment-key",
  variations: ["red", "green"],
  # Filter by context attributes
  condition: {
    country: {
      "$in": ["US", "CA"]
    }
  },
  # Adjust variation weights from the default 50/50 split
  weights: [0.8, 0.2],
  # Run for a subset of traffic (0 to 1, default = 1)
  coverage: 0.5,
  # Use a different context attribute for assigning a variation (default = "id")
  hash_attribute: "device_id",
  # Use a namespace to run mutually exclusive experiments
  namespace: ["pricing-page", 0, 0.25]
))
```

## Working with Encrypted features

You can learn more about [SDK Connection Endpoint Encryption](/app/api#encryption).

Create a `GrowthBook::Context` with an encrypted payload and a decryption key:

```rb
# TODO: Replace these values with your own:
Growthbook::Context.new(
  encrypted_features: 'm5ylFM6ndyOJA2OPadubkw==.Uu7ViqgKEt/dWvCyhI46q088PkAEJbnXKf3KPZjf9IEQQ+A8fojNoxw4wIbPX3aj',
  decryption_key: 'Zvwv/+uhpFDznZ6SX28Yjg==',
  attributes: {
    id: '456',
    country: 'CA'
  }
)
```

When fetching features from the GrowthBook SDK endpoint, the encrypted features are available on a property `encryptedFeatures` instead of plain text on the property `features`. Here's an example with networking:

```rb
uri = URI('https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/MY_API_KEY')
res = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
encrypted_features = res.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess) ? JSON.parse(res.body)['encryptedFeatures'] : nil

Growthbook::Context.new(
  encrypted_features: encrypted_features,
  decryption_key: '<key-for-decrypting>',
  attributes: {
    id: '456',
    country: 'CA'
  }
)
```
