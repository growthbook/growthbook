# Flutter

This SDK supports the following versions:

- **Android version 21 & above**
- **iOS version 12 & Above**
- **Apple TvOS version 13 & Above**
- **Apple WatchOS version 7 & Above**

## Installation

Add this to your `pubspec.yaml` file

```
growthbook_sdk_flutter: ^3.9.1
```

## Quick Usage

To create a GrowthBook SDK instance, use `GBSDKBuilderApp`. Then, you can evaluate feature flags or run experiments.

```dart
// User attributes for targeting and assigning users to experiment variations
Map<String, dynamic> attrs = {};
attrs.addAll({
  'id': '123',
  'env': 'dev',
  'betaUser': true,
});

final GrowthBookSDK sdkInstance = await GBSDKBuilderApp(
  apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
  hostURL: '<GrowthBook_URL>',
  attributes: {
    attrs
  },
  // Called whenever someone is put into an experiment
  growthBookTrackingCallBack: (gbExperiment, gbExperimentResult) {
    // TODO: track in your analytics system
    print("Viewed Experiment");
    print("Experiment Id: ${gbExperiment.key}");
    print("Variation Id: ${gbExperimentResult.variationID}");
  },
  // View your encryption key on the Features → SDKs page
  encryptionKey = "insert_your_encription_key_if_you_are_using_encryption",
).initialize();

if (gb.feature("my-feature").on) {
  // Feature is enabled!
}
```

## Using Features

The `feature` method takes a String feature name and returns a `GBFeatureResult` object with a few useful properties:

- **value** (`dynamic`) - The assigned value of the feature
- **on** (`bool`) - The value cast to a boolean
- **off** (`bool`) - The value cast to a boolean and then negated
- **source** (`String`) - Why the value was assigned to the user. One of "unknownFeature", "defaultValue", "force", or "experiment"

When the source is "experiment", there are 2 additional properties that tell you which experiment was used and more details about the result of the experiment:

- **experiment** (`GBExperiment`)
- **experimentResult** (`GBExperimentResult`)

Here are some examples:

```dart
GBFeatureResult feature = gb.feature("my-feature")

// Do something if feature is truthy
if (feature.on) { }

// Do something if feature is falsy
if (feature.off) { }

// Print the actual value of the feature
// (depending on the feature, might be a string, number, boolean, etc.)
print(feature.value)

// Print the experiment id used to assign the feature value
if (feature.source == "experiment") {
  print(feature.experiment.key)
}
```

## Running Inline Experiments

Instead of just using features defined in the GrowthBook API, you can run an experiment directly. This is done with the `run` method, which takes a `GBExperiment` object as an argument and returns a `GBExperimentResult` object:

```dart
var exp = GBExperiment()
exp.key = "my-experiment"
exp.variations = List.of("control", "variation")

var result = gb.run(exp)

// Either "control" or "variation"
print(result.value)
```

The `GBExperiment` class has two required properties - `key` and `variations`. There are also a number of optional properties:

- **key** (`String`) - The unique identifier for this experiment
- **variations** (`dynamic[]`) - Array of variations to decide between
- **weights** (`double[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.
- **active** (`bool`) - If set to false, always return the control (first variation)
- **coverage** (`double`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)
- **condition** (`GBCondition`) - Optional targeting condition
- **namespace** (`[String, int, int]`) - Adds the experiment to a namespace
- **force** (`int`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specific variation index
- **hashAttribute** (`String`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to `id`)

The `GBExperimentResult` object returns the following properties:

- **inExperiment** (`bool`)
- **variationId** (`int`) - The array index of the assigned variation
- **value** (`dynamic`) - The value of the assigned variation
- **hashAttribute** (`String`) - The user attribute used to assign a variation
- **hashValue** (`String`) - The value of the attribute used to assign a variation
