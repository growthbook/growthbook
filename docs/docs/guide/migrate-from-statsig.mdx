# Migrate from Statsig

This guide walks through migrating feature flags, experiments, and SDKs from Statsig to GrowthBook.

## Import Your Statsig Data

Use GrowthBook's import tool to migrate your Statsig configuration and experiments.

:::warning
The Statsig import tool is currently in a private beta. Please contact support@growthbook.io if you're interested in using it.
:::

### Step 1: Generate Statsig API Key

- In Statsig, go to **Settings** â†’ ** Key & Environments**
- Create a new "Console" key with read-only permissions
- Copy the key (it starts with `secret-`)

### Step 2: Run the Import

- In GrowthBook, go to **Settings** â†’ **Import your data**
- Select Statsig
- Enter your Statsig API key
- Click **Fetch from Statsig** 

The import tool will retrieve:

- Environments (production, staging, etc.)
- Tags
- Segments 
- Feature Gates
- Dynamic Configs
- Experiments

### Step 3: Review and Confirm

Items will show as:

- **Pending**: Will be imported
- **Skipped**: Already exists in GrowthBook

You can:

- Uncheck items to remove them from the import
- Click the arrow (>) to view item details
- Click **Import to GrowthBook** when ready

When **Status** is marked as complete, your data is available in GrowthBook ðŸŽ‰

### Installation

Download the subagent to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
# Create the agents directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/

# Download the agent file
curl -o ~/.claude/agents/statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growthbook/claude-statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator/main/.claude/agents/statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator.md
```

### Using the Subagent

In Claude Code, simply ask:

> "I need to migrate this code from the Statsig SDK to the GrowthBook SDK: (@filename or directory)"

The subagent will:

- Convert import statements to GrowthBook SDK
- Transform feature gates to boolean flags
- Migrate dynamic configs to feature values
- Flatten `StatsigUser` objects to GrowthBook attributes
- Generate a migration report with any manual steps needed

ðŸ”— See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/growthbook/claude-statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator) for more details.
