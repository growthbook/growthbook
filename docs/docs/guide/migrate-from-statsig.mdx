This guide helps you migrate your feature flags, experiments, SDKs, and more from Statsig to GrowthBook.

## Import Your Statsig Data

GrowthBook provides an import tool to migrate your data from Statsig to GrowthBook. 

:::warning
The Statsig import tool is currently in a private beta. Please contact support@growthbook.io if you're interested in using it.
:::

### Requirements
- A Statsig Console API Key with read access (see Step 1)
- Admin access to GrowthBook

### Step 1: Generate Statsig API Key

- In Statsig, go to **Settings** â†’ ** Key & Environments**
- Create a new key with the "Console" type and make it read only
- Copy the key (it starts with `secret-`)

### Step 2: Run the Import

- In GrowthBook, go to **Settings** â†’ **Import your data**
- Select Statsig from the list
- Enter your Statsig API key
- Click **Fetch from Statsig** 

The import tool will retrieve:

- Environments (production, staging, etc.)
- Tags
- Segments 
- Feature Gates
- Dynamic Configs
- Experiments
- Metrics

### Step 3: Review and Confirm

Items slated to be imported will be marked as "pending." Items that already exist in GrowthBook will be marked as "skipped" and won't be imported.

You can: 
- Uncheck items to remove them from the import
- View details about any item by toggling the caret
- **Import to GrowthBook** when ready

When **Status** is marked as complete, your data is available in GrowthBook ðŸŽ‰

### Installation

Download the subagent to your Claude Code agents directory:

```bash
# Create the agents directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/

# Download the agent file
curl -o ~/.claude/agents/statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/growthbook/claude-statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator/main/.claude/agents/statsig-to-growthbook-sdk-migrator.md
```

### Using the Subagent

In Claude Code, simply ask:

> "I need to migrate this code from the Statsig SDK to the GrowthBook SDK: [filename]"

The subagent will:

- Convert import statements to GrowthBook SDK
- Transform feature gates to boolean flags
- Migrate dynamic configs to feature values
- Flatten `StatsigUser` objects to GrowthBook attributes
- Generate a migration report with any manual steps needed
