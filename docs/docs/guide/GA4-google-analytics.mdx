# Configuring GrowthBook to work with Google Analytics - GA4

GrowthBook connects to Google Analytics (GA4) via BigQuery. This process is straight forward, and outlined below.
You can also find Google's documentation on how to create this link [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238).

## 1. Create a BigQuery Project (if you don't have one)

If you don't have a BigQuery project, you'll need to create one. Go to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-1-project-list.png"
  alt="GA4 - BigQuery create project"
  style={{ width: 800, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Click on **_Create new project_** from the right and give your project a name.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-2-create-project.png"
  alt="GA4 - BigQuery create project"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Once created, you'll be redirected to the BigQuery dashboard.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-3-new-project.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 800, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

If you created a new project, the BigQuery API is automatically enabled. Otherwise, you'll need to enable it manually [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery)

:::note

If you are just testing GrowthBook with GA4 out, you can use the sandbox project that Google provides for free. When you create a new cloud project the sandbox should be automatically enabled. You can find more information about the sandbox [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox).

## 2. Connect Google Analytics to BigQuery

Log into your Google Analytics account and navigate to the Admin section. From there, make sure you have selected the right property, and scroll down to **_Product Links_** section. Click on the menu named **_BigQuery Links_**

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-4-link-to-bigquery-1.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 700, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Click on the **_Link_** button. This will open a menu that allows you select the project. Select on the **_Choose a BigQuery Project_** link.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-2.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 700, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Select the project you wish to send your GA4 data to:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-3.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery connect to project"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Then click **_next_**

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-4.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery connected to project"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

On the next step you'll be presented with some options about the connection.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-5.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery link options"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Here you can choose the frequency of data updates, either daily or streaming. To use Streaming, you'll need a BigQuery account with billing info added. Depending on your use case, daily updates may be sufficient.

On the final step you'll be asked to confirm your choices. When finished, you should see something like this, verifying that the connection was successful.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-6.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery successfully connected"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

And then your BigQuery link will show up on the listing page:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-7.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery successfully connected"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

## 3. Configure BigQuery for GrowthBook

You'll need to give GrowthBook some permissions to your BigQuery project so that we can access the data. We have created a guide just for this, which you can find [here](https://docs.growthbook.io/guide/bigquery)

## 4. Connect GrowthBook to BigQuery

Within GrowthBook, navigate to the **_Analysis_** section, and then click on the **_Data Sources_** page. Add a new data source, and select **_Google Analytics (GA4)_**.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-6-add-GA4-datasource.png"
  alt="GrowthBook connect to GA4"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-6-add-GA4-datasource2.png"
  alt="GrowthBook connect to GA4"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Then add your BigQuery connection info. GrowthBook will pre-populate the SQL queries required to use your GA4 data. You can also add a custom SQL query if you want to use a different table or filter the data in some way as you like.

Once connected, you'll be able to add any additional metrics or dimensions, and then you can use your GA4 data for your experiments.
