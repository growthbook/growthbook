GrowthBook and Contentful work together to enable content teams to run A/B tests without requiring developer intervention for each test. Once configured, content editors can create and manage experiments directly within the Contentful interface, eliminating the need for code changes. With these experiments, teams can leverage GrowthBook's advanced experimentation analysis to understand outcomes and make informed product decisions.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [GrowthBook account](https://www.growthbook.io/ "https://www.growthbook.io") (free tier available)
- [Contentful account](https://www.contentful.com/ "https://www.contentful.com") (free tier available)

## Key concepts

### Experiment content type

Installing GrowthBook's Contentful plugin adds a new **GrowthBook Experiment** content type to your Contentful space. This content type lets you create GrowthBook experiments right from the Contentful interface.

### Variations field

The **GrowthBook Experiment** includes a **Variations** field that acts as a container for the content you want to test. For example, to test which featured product increases sales the most, you'd add these products to the **Variations** container.

### Experiment

Once configured, you're ready to start your experiment. This syncs the data created in Contentful with GrowthBook, so you can analyze the experiment results and see which version of your test performs best.

The diagram below illustrates how the above components work together.

## Set up GrowthBook

### 1. Create an SDK Connection

An SDK connection is a link between your GrowthBook account, your frontend codebase, and the Contentful plugin. It allows GrowthBook to serve the correct content variations to your users.

1. Log in to GrowthBook
2. Navigate to **SDK Configuration** → **SDK Connections** in the sidebar
3. Click **Add SDK Connection**
4. Select **JavaScript** or **React** as your language
5. Save your **API Host** URL for later use

### 2. Configure data source

A data source is the connection between GrowthBook and your analytics platform. This connection allows GrowthBook to analyze your experiment data and provide insights. It's also informs Contentful which data source to use when creating experiments.

1. Go to **Metrics and Data** → **Data Sources** in GrowthBook
2. Click **Add Data Source**
3. Choose your preferred analytics platform
4. Follow the connection guide
5. Save your data source ID (found in the URL of your data source page)

### 3. Generate API key

To connect Contentful to GrowthBook, you need an API key with admin permissions. This key allows Contentful to communicate with GrowthBook and sync your experiments.

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Select `admin` role
4. Save the generated key securely

## Install and configure the GrowthBook app

1. Go to **Apps** → **Marketplace**
2. Search for GrowthBook
3. Click **Install**
4. Configure the plugin:

- Enter your GrowthBook API host URL from step 1
- Enter your data source ID from step 2
- Enter your Admin API key from step 3
- Click **Save**

## Run your first experiment

With everything configured, you're ready to run your first experiment.

1. Add the **GrowthBook Experiment** to a page
   In Contentful, open the content entry where you want to add the experiment. Add the **GrowthBook Experiment** content type. (You may have to update the page to accept the new content type.)
2. Add **Variations**
   Name your experiment. Add your variations by linking existing Contentful entries or creating new ones.
3. Launch experiment
   Click **Create New Experiment** and then **Start Experiment**. This will sync your variations and experiment data to GrowthBook and start your A/B test.
4. Publish changes
   Publish changes to the **Experiment** content as well as to the page that contains the experiment. Your changes will now be live, serving different content to users!

</video>

## Frontend integration

To accommodate the **GrowthBook Experiment** type, changes need to be made to your frontend codebase.

At a high level, this means adding the GrowthBook SDK to your codebase so that the content variations returned by Contentful are properly rendered: `User 123` sees `Product A`, while `User XYZ` sees `Product B`.

Your particular implementation will depend on your codebase and will require a developer's help. The good news is that this change only needs to be made once to enable streamlined A/B testing directly from Contentful. We also have a [full example project](https://github.com/growthbook/examples) shows how to integrate Contentful and GrowthBook with Next.js.

### Tracking callback

An essential part of configuring the GrowthBook SDK is setting up the tracking callback. It's what sends the experiment exposure data (that `User 123` saw `Product A`) to your data warehouse, which, in turn, enables GrowthBook to analyze your experiment and determine which variation performed best.

## FAQs and troubleshooting

### Common questions

**Q: How does the GrowthBook app affect my Contentful environment?**
A: The app creates a new content type called GrowthBook Experiment that enables A/B testing functionality.

**Q: Where can I activate my experiments?**
A: Experiments are managed through both Contentful (content variations) and GrowthBook (experiment settings and analysis).

**Q: What happens after an experiment is complete?**
A: Replace the GrowthBook Experiment content with the winning variation.

### Troubleshooting

**Variations not showing up?**

- Ensure all variation content is published
- Verify the experiment is properly configured in Contentful and GrowthBook
- Check that the frontend integration is correctly implemented

**Configuration not saving?**

- Make sure to click the "Save" button after making changes
- Verify you have the necessary permissions in both platforms
