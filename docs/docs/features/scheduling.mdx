# Scheduling Features

![Feature Scheduling](/images/features/feature-scheduling.png)

If you have a Pro or Enterprise plan, you can schedule features to turn on or off at a specific date and time. This is
useful for things like turning features on or off for holidays or special promotions.

Scheduling features is currently supported with all rule types, including force rules, rollout rules, and
experiment rules - and just like non-scheduled rules, they will override the default value when all conditions
are met.
