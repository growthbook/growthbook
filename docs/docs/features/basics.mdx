This page covers the core concepts you'll need to create and configure feature flags in GrowthBook.

## Feature Keys

Every feature is defined by a unique **key**. This is what your engineering team references in code when checking the value of a feature. Feature keys **cannot** be changed after creation, so take care when choosing one. If you make a mistake, delete the feature and create a new one.

:::warning Naming Conventions
Feature keys must only include letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (\_).

## Feature State

Feature flags can be enabled or disabled. When a flag is disabled, GrowthBook excludes the feature from the API response. The feature evaluates to `null` and ignores all targeting and rules. In your app, the SDK will render the feature with the fallback value.

Here's an example from the JavaScript SDK:

```js
const showNewCheckout = gb.isOn('new-checkout')
// Renders false if the feature is disabled

const buttonColor = gb.getFeatureValue('button-color', 'red')
// Renders 'red' if the feature is disabled
```

## Feature Types

Features can be a simple ON/OFF flag or a more complex data type (string, number, or JSON).

| Type        | Values               | Best for                                               | Example                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Boolean** | `true` / `false`     | Simple on/off toggles, kill switches, gradual rollouts | `show-onboarding-checklist`                   |
| **String**  | Any string           | Remote config, multivariate A/B tests                  | `button-color` set to `"red"`, `"blue"`, etc. |
| **Number**  | Any integer or float | Numeric configuration values                           | `results-per-page` set to `10`, `25`, `50`    |
| **JSON**    | Any JSON object      | Complex configuration, multiple values in one flag     | `{"maxRetries": 3, "timeout": 5000}`          |

**Boolean** flags are the most common. They're limited to two variations in A/B tests (on/off), so if you need more variations, like testing three different button colors, use a string, number, or JSON flag instead.

**JSON** flags also support JSON Schema validation, which lets you enforce the structure of the value before it reaches your application.

## Default Values

Each feature has a default value that's used when there are no matching rules for the user. A feature that is enabled on an environment with no rules uses the default value. Default values match the feature type.

Here's an example from the JavaScript SDK:

```js
// For boolean features
if (growthbook.isOn("my-feature")) {
  // ... Do something when the feature is on
}

// For number, string, and JSON features
const value = growthbook.getFeatureValue("other-feature", "fallback");
```

Default values can be overridden by **Rules**, which let you target specific users, roll out to a percentage of traffic, or run A/B experiments.

## What's Next

Now that you understand keys, types, and default values, the next concepts to explore are:

- **[Environments](/features/environments)** — Control where a feature is active (e.g., enabled in dev but not production). Each environment has its own SDK connection and independent set of rules.
- **[Rules](/features/rules)** — Override default values by targeting specific users, rolling out to a percentage of traffic, or running A/B experiments. See [Choosing a Rule Type](/features/choosing-a-rule-type) for help picking the right approach.
- **[Targeting Conditions](/features/targeting)** — Define _who_ sees a rule using attributes like user ID, country, or plan type.
