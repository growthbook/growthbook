# Stale Feature Flag Detection

Over time, some feature flags become "stale" — they're no longer actively used or relevant, but they remain in your system. Stale flags add clutter to your dashboard and make it harder to understand which flags actually matter. GrowthBook can automatically detect these flags so you can clean them up.

## Viewing Stale Flags

Stale flags are surfaced in the main feature flag table. Look for the **Stale** column, which indicates whether a flag has been marked stale.

You can also see the stale indicator on individual feature pages, next to the feature name.

## How GrowthBook Determines Stale Status

Hover over the warning icon next to a stale flag to see the specific reason it was flagged.

A flag is considered stale if it hasn't been updated in two weeks **and** meets at least one of these criteria:

- No active environments (the flag is disabled everywhere)
- One-sided rules that send 100% of traffic to a single variation

## Toggling Stale Detection

You can disable stale detection for a specific flag from the feature details page or from the features table.

<video autoPlay loop muted style={{width: '100%', height: "auto", marginBlockEnd: "1.5rem", border: "1px solid var(--color-border)"}} controls allowFullScreen>
    <source src="/videos/stale-ff-overview-never-stale.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

To re-enable stale detection, navigate to the menu in the top right of the feature details page.

<video autoPlay loop muted style={{width: '100%', height: "auto", marginBlockEnd: "1.5rem", border: "1px solid var(--color-border)"}} controls allowFullScreen>
    <source src="/videos/stale-ff-never-stale-page.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
