Prerequisite features gate other features, [rules](/features/rules), and experiments based on the state of a prerequisite feature.

Common use cases:

- Grouping multiple related features under a single release feature (e.g., `release-2.8`) and toggling them all at once
- Creating a hierarchy of dependent features and safely enabling them in the correct order, per environment
- Only enabling a set of features if the user would be bucketed into "variant 1" of an experiment

There are two types of prerequisite features in GrowthBook: **Top-level Prerequisites** (feature gating) and **Inline Prerequisite Targeting** (rule-level and experiment-level gating).

## Top-Level Prerequisites

Top-level prerequisites are defined per dependent feature. They function similarly to a feature's kill switches: if the prerequisite feature is not serving `true` then the dependent feature will not be enabled.

Add one or more top-level prerequisites by clicking **Add Prerequisite Feature** on the feature page and selecting the feature you want to use as a prerequisite.

For a feature to be eligible as a top-level prerequisite, it must be a boolean (true/false) and in the same project as the dependent feature.

### Prerequisite States and Values

A summary of the prerequisite state and value appears while adding or editing a prerequisite, as well as on the dependent feature page.

- **Deterministic** states (**live** and **not live**) are applied to your features within GrowthBook.
  - **Live** prerequisites which are serving `true` will allow their dependent features to be enabled
  - **Live** prerequisites which are serving `false` will still block their dependent features (`false` ≠ `true`)
  - **Not live** prerequisites will always block their dependent features (they evaluate to `null`, and `null` ≠ `true`)

:::info
Prerequisites with deterministic states work "out of the box" regardless of SDK version support.

Any feature that is always "not live" will not be seen by the SDK. Any feature that is always "live" will no longer reference its prerequisites in the SDK. This means that no SDK-level evaluation of prerequisites is needed (these prerequisites work irrespective of SDK version support).
:::

- **Schrödinger** state means that the prerequisite's state cannot be determined in advance. It may depend on user attributes or other non-deterministic factors. (This is homage to the physicist Erwin Schrödinger who proposed a thought experiment involving a cat in a box that is both alive and dead at the same time.)

:::info
Prerequisites with a Schrödinger state must be evaluated at runtime in the SDK. Prerequisite evaluation is supported in the following SDK versions:

- JavaScript: `0.34.0+`
- React: `0.24.0+`
- Python: `1.1.0+`
- C#: `1.1.0+`
- Golang: `0.2.0+`
- Java: `0.9.7+`
- Kotlin: `1.1.60+`
- Swift: `1.0.56+`
- Ruby: `1.3.0+`

## Inline Prerequisite Targeting

Inline prerequisite targeting provides finer-grained control than top-level prerequisites.

1. Inline prerequisites can be applied at a feature's [rule](/features/rules) level, and can be environment-specific. This comes with the added benefits of feature draft releases and approvals.
2. Inline prerequisites can be applied to individual experiments which may not be linked to a specific feature (such as visual experiments).
3. Inline prerequisite targeting is not limited to boolean features. You can specify any evaluation condition you'd like (ex: prerequisite value is: greater than 3, in a list of allowed values, or matches a regex pattern). You can even do advanced targeting with JSON.

<CommercialFeature feature="prerequisite-targeting" />

To create an inline prerequisite within a feature, add prerequisite targeting to an existing rule or create a new rule with prerequisite targeting. You can specify one or more prerequisite features within the same project and give each a custom evaluation condition. A similar flow exists while editing the targeting rules of an experiment.

### Inline Prerequisite States and Values

The same **deterministic** and **Schrödinger** states apply to inline prerequisites as they do to top-level prerequisites ([see above](#prerequisite-states-and-values)). Below is a summary of how they apply to inline prerequisites:

- **Deterministic** states (**live** and **not live**) are calculated using your evaluation condition, which is **_not_** limited to `is true`. As before, no run-time evaluation of prerequisites is required in the SDK.
  - **Live** prerequisites which pass the evaluation condition will allow their dependent rules or experiments to be enabled.
  - **Live** prerequisites which fail the evaluation condition will still block their dependent rules or experiments.
  - **Not live** prerequisites will generally block the dependent rule or experiment, unless the evaluation condition specifically checks for this (e.g. `is not live`)

- **Schrödinger** state prerequisites must be evaluated at runtime in the SDK, and thus a compatible SDK version is required.

## Limitations

GrowthBook enforces the following limitations when configuring prerequisites:

1. Prerequisite features must be in the same project as the dependent feature or experiment.
2. You cannot select a prerequisite that would lead to a circular dependency.
3. If you don't have an SDK which supports prerequisite evaluation, then you cannot select a prerequisite that is in a Schrödinger state.
4. Once a feature has been used as a prerequisite for other features or experiments, you are blocked from deleting, archiving, or changing its projects. To perform these actions, you must first remove the feature from all dependent features and experiments. You can see a list of dependencies on the feature page:
