# Code References

## Overview

Code References allows teams to quickly see instances of feature flags being leveraged in their codebase. By scanning customersâ€™ code bases via a CLI tool and sending results to our application backend, GrowthBook can help surface valuable information such as flagging stale feature flags more accurately, and directing devs to the exact lines of code that need to be cleaned up.

## Getting Started

For GitHub users, we provide a streamlined GitHub Action that is easy-to-set up and geting with code references.

For non-GitHub users, we provide all the tools you need to get set up with code references with your platform of choice.
