## Targeting Attributes

Feature values can be targeted to specific users or groups of users. In order for this to work, you must pass targeting
attributes into the GrowthBook SDK and also list them in the GrowthBook App.

This is an example of specifying the targeting attributes in the SDK:

```ts
growthbook.setAttributes({
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  country: user.country,
  url: window.location.href,
  userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
  admin: user.isAdmin,
  age: user.age,
});
```

You can update the attributes in the GrowthBook App under **SDK Connections** > **Attributes**:

:::note

The actual values of the targeting attributes (e.g. the user ids, emails, etc.) are never sent to GrowthBook. They are only stored in memory locally within the SDK. This architecture
eliminates huge potential security holes and keeps your user's PII safe and secure.

:::

Each attribute has 3 parts:

- The **attribute name** itself. This is how the attribute will be referenced in the SDK.
- The **data type** of the attribute
- Whether it's an **identifier**. Identifiers are attributes which uniquely identify something - typically either a person, account, company, or device- and are used for experiment assignments.

### Attribute Data Types

GrowthBook supports the following attribute data types:

- Boolean - true or false
- Number - Floats or integers
- String - freeform text
- Enum - When there are only a small list of pre-defined values it could take
- Secure String - Like a string, but the values will be hashed before passing to the SDK
- Array of Strings - useful for things like "tags"
- Array of Numbers - useful anytime you have multiple numeric values
- Array of Secure Strings - an array of secure strings useful for passing multiple values that you want to keep secure

#### Semantic Version Targeting

In version 2.2, we introduced support for semantic version targeting. Using the string data type and defining a format, you can leverage semantic versioning comparisons in your targeting definitions.

To leverage this feature, you first need to create a version string attribute. Navigate to **SDK Configurations > Attributes** and create or edit a String attribute. In the format dropdown, select: **Version string.**

When defining the semantic version targeting condition for a feature flag, just select the string attribute and the appropriate comparison operator.

## Saved Groups

GrowthBook lets you save frequently used targeting conditions as **Saved Groups**. When you update a Saved Group, every feature and experiment that references it will automatically sync to the latest value.
