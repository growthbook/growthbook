# Environments

GrowthBook comes with one environment by default (**production**), but you can add as many as you need on the
[Environments page](https://app.growthbook.io/environments) located within the **SDK Configuration** menu.

Feature flags can be enabled and disabled on a per-environment basis. You can also set the default feature state for any new environment. Additionally, you can scope environments to only be available in specific projects, allowing for further control and segmentation over feature delivery.

When a feature is disabled in an environment, the feature will not be returned via the SDK, and that feature will always
evaluate to `null` and ignore any other targeting or feature rules.

:::note

It's possible for a feature to be enabled for an environment and still be considered "off". This happens when its value is set to `false`, `null`, `0`, or an empty string.

## Environments and SDKs

When you configure your SDK endpoint you will be asked which environment you want to use. Each SDK endpoint will have a
unique SDK key. When this endpoint is called from the code, a JSON file containing all the features and rules by which
they should be shown is returned. Scoping SDKs to environments allows you to easily separate, for example, your
production and development environments.

To use multiple environments in the same code base, you can use environment variables to set a dynamic key,
e.g. `GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY='sdk-abc123'` and then reference that environment variable in your code base. Depending on
the framework you're using, some environment variables are not exposed by default on the front-end unless provided an
appropriate prefix, e.g. `NEXT_GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY='sdk-abc123'` in order to access environment variables in Next.js
client code.

## Environment Inheritance

When creating an environment via the API, you can specify a `parent` environment it should inherit from.
The newly created environment will share the same feature rules as its parent for all features that exist
at the time of creation. Any changes to feature rules in either the parent or the new environment will
not be shared and will cause the two environments to diverge. In other words, the new environment is
a clone or fork of the parent.

:::note

**Environment Inheritance** is a GrowthBook Enterprise feature.

:::

There are two main usages for Environment Inheritance:

1. After setting up GrowthBook, you decide that you want to add a new environment but you've already
   created feature rules, e.g. adding "staging" after only having "dev" and "production"
2. When troubleshooting unexpected behavior with feature rules in production, it can be useful to
   create an independent environment that you can make changes to safely to help diagnose the cause
   of the behavior.
