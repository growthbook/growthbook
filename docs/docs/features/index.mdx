Feature flags let you control your application's behavior from GrowthBook, without deploying new code. Target specific users, gradually roll out changes, or run A/B tests on the client or the server.

Feature flags decouple deploys from releases. Release code more frequently and with less risk by launching to a subset of users, ramping up gradually, or turning any change into an experiment.

## Getting Started

To use feature flags, set up an [SDK Connection](/sdk-connections), then explore the docs below.

### Learn the Basics

- [Fundamentals](/features/basics) — Keys, feature types, default values, and publishing
- [Environments](/features/environments) — Control which features are enabled per environment (dev, staging, production)

### Set Up Targeting and Rules

- [Rules](/features/rules) — How rules work, choosing a rule type, and configuring forced values, rollouts, experiments, and scheduling
- [Targeting Conditions](/features/targeting) — Define who sees a feature using attributes, conditions, and saved groups
- [Safe Rollouts](/features/safe-rollouts) — Release features with automatic guardrail monitoring
- [Prerequisites](/features/prerequisites) — Gate features based on the state of other features

### Manage Flags at Scale

- [Publishing & Approval Flows](/features/publishing-and-approval-flows) — Drafts, revisions, merge conflicts, and requiring approvals
- [Stale Feature Detection](/features/stale-detection) — Identify flags that may no longer be in use
- [Code References](/features/code-references) — Find where flags are used in your codebase
- [Feature Diagnostics](/features/diagnostics) — Inspect feature evaluations in production
- [Custom Hooks](/features/custom-hooks) — Extend GrowthBook with custom validation logic (self-hosted Enterprise)
