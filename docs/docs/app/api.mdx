# API <Pill>beta</Pill>

GrowthBook offers a full REST API for interacting with the GrowthBook application. This is currently in **beta** as we add more authenticated API routes and features.

Request data can use either JSON or Form data encoding (with proper `Content-Type` headers). All response bodies are JSON-encoded.

The API base URL for GrowthBook Cloud is `https://api.growthbook.io`. For self-hosted deployments, it is the same as your API_HOST environment variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3100`). The rest of these docs will assume you are using GrowthBook Cloud.

## Authentication

We support both the HTTP Basic and Bearer authentication schemes for convenience.

You first need to generate a new Secret Key in GrowthBook by going to `Settings -> API Keys`.

If using HTTP Basic auth, pass the Secret Key as the username and leave the password blank:

```bash
curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456:
# The ":" at the end stops curl from asking for a password
```

If using Bearer auth, pass the Secret Key as the token:

```bash
curl https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_abc123DEF456"
```

## Errors

The API may return the following error status codes:

- **400** - Bad Request - Often due to a missing required parameter
- **401** - Unauthorized - No valid API key provided
- **402** - Request Failed - The parameters are valid, but the request failed
- **403** - Forbidden - Provided API key does not have the required access
- **404** - Not Found - Unknown API route or requested resource
- **429** - Too Many Requests - You exceeded the rate limit of 60 requests per minute. Try again later.
- **5XX** - Server Error - Something went wrong on GrowthBook's end (these are rare)

The response body will be a JSON object with the following properties:

- **message** - Information about the error

## Pagination

All list methods are paginated and support the querystring parameters:

- `limit` - number to return, between 1 and 100, default `10`
- `offset` - how many to skip, default `0`

For example:

```bash
curl -G https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1/features \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456:
  -d limit=5
  -d offset=10
# Return features 11-15
```

And the response will contain the fields:

- `limit` - The limit used for the current request
- `offset` - The offset used for the current request
- `count` - Number returned in the response
- `total` - Total number of items
- `hasMore` - `true` if there is another page, `false` if there are no more items
- `nextOffset` - Offset to fetch the next page, or `null` if there are no more results

## Features

### The Feature Object

This object represents a single feature in your account. Features are complex objects with many nested properties.

<details className="mb-3">

### Toggle Feature

`POST /api/v1/features/:key/toggle`

This endpoint controls the environment toggles for features.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.growthbook.io/api/v1/features/my-feature/toggle \
  -u secret_abc123DEF456: \
  -d "environments[production]"=false \
  -d reason="Kill switch activated"
```

The request body contains the following fields:

- **environments** - An object mapping environment names to the desired toggle state. Not all environments need to be specified, only those you want to change.
- **reason** - An optional string explaining why you are making this change (for the audit trail)

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON</summary>

```json
{
  "environments": {
    "dev": true,
    "production": false
  },
  "reason": "Kill switch activated"
}
```

</details>

The reponse body contains the new Feature object after the changes are applied.

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

## SDK Connection Endpoints

SDK Connection Endpoints provide readonly access to a subset of your feature flags, just enough for the [GrowthBook SDKs](/lib) to assign values to users. They are meant to be public and do not require authentication to view.

In **GrowthBook Cloud**, the SDK Connection Endpoints are served from our global CDN: `https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/...`. If you are self-hosting, you can run the [GrowthBook Proxy server](/self-host/proxy), which provides built-in caching and performance optimizations.

SDK Connection Endpoints are scoped to a single Environment (e.g. `dev` or `production`) and can also be scoped to a single Project. Manage all of your SDK Connections on the **Features -> SDKs** page.

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  features: {
    [key: string]: FeatureDefinition
  }
}

interface FeatureDefinition {
  defaultValue: any;
  rules?: FeatureDefinitionRule[];
}

interface FeatureDefinitionRule {
  force?: any;
  weights?: number[];
  variations?: any[];
  hashAttribute?: string;
  namespace?: [string, number, number];
  key?: string;
  coverage?: number;
  condition?: any;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "features": {
    "feature-key": {
      "defaultValue": true
    },
    "another-feature": {
      "defaultValue": "blue",
      "rules": [
        {
          "condition": {
            "browser": "firefox"
          },
          "force": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Encryption

If you've enabled encryption for your SDK endpoint, the response format changes:

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEncryptedEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  encryptedFeatures: string;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "encryptedFeatures": "abcdef123456GHIJKL0987654321..."
}
```

</details>

You will need to decrypt the features first before passing into the SDK. Our front-end SDKs (Javascript and React) handle this for you automatically and we're in the process of adding built-in support to our other SDKs.
