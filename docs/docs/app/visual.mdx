# Visual Editor <Pill>beta</Pill>

The Visual Editor enables non-technical users to create A/B tests without writing code.

You can decide on a test-by-test basis whether you want to write code using the SDKs or use the Visual Editor.

## Setup

This feature is disabled by default and must be turned on under Settings.

Once enabled, you will see the `<script>` tags that must be added to the site you want to test. It will look something like this:

```html
<script>
  window.GROWTHBOOK_CONFIG = {
    // Optional logged-in user id
    userId: "123",
    // Impression tracking callback (e.g. Segment, Mixpanel, GA)
    track: function (experimentId, variationId) {
      analytics.track("Experiment Viewed", {
        experimentId,
        variationId,
      });
    },
  };
</script>
<script async src="http://localhost:3100/js/key_abc123.js"></script>
```

### Config Options

The following config options are allowed:

- **userId** - The logged-in user id for the current user
- **anonId** - An anonymous identifier for the user (deviceId, cookieId, sessionId, etc.)
- **groups** - An array of groups the user belongs to. Used for targeting. (e.g. `internal`, `qa`, `premium`, etc.)
- **enabled** - If set to `false`, no experiments will be run
- **track** - A function that will be called every time the user is put into an experiment. Use this to track the impression in your analytics tool (GA, Segment, Mixpanel, or something else).

#### User/Anon Ids

If no `anonId` is set in the config options, a new one will be generated and persisted in localStorage.

Experiments can target based on a login state of `Anonymous` or `User`.
If a user is missing the specified id type, they will be excluded from the experiment.
This login state also determines which id will be used for assinging users to variations.

#### SPA Support

If you have a Single Page Application (SPA) that does client-side routing, you'll need to refresh experiments on a route change.

For example, with Next.js you can add the following to your `pages/_app.js` component:

```ts
const router = useRouter();

useEffect(() => {
  const onChange = () => window.growthbook?.refresh();
  router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", onChange);
  return () => router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", onChange);
}, []);
```

This will revert all previously running experiments and start new ones based on the latest value of `window.location.href`.

## Using the Editor

When creating an experiment, you can choose to create a `Code` experiment (using an SDK) or a `Visual` experiment (using the Visual Editor).

![Experiment Form](/images/experiment-type-form.png)

After creating a Visual experiment, you can open the editor. Here you can inject CSS styles to the page and specify DOM mutations (e.g. changing innerHTML or adding a class to an element).

![Visual Editor](/images/visual-editor.png)

There is even a built-in screenshot tool if you want an easy way to capture what each variation looks like.

## QA

Once you have a draft Visual experiment, you can preview variations by adding a querystring to your site.

For example, `http://example.com/?my-experiment=1`. The querystring key is the experiment "tracking key" and the value is the variation number (`0` is the control, `1` is the first variation, etc.)

Until an experiment is moved out of the "draft" phase and started, this is the only way to view it on your site.

## Production

When an experiment is started, users are immediately assigned variations.

If an experiment is stopped and a winner is declared, the winning variation will be rolled out to 100% of users.
If you later go back and implement the winning variation in code, you can **archive** the experiment in GrowthBook
and it will stop being included in the javascript code.
