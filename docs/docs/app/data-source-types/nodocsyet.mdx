                Unfortunately, even though Growthbook fully works with {datasource}, a How-To guide for {datasource} hasn't been written yet.  We do have a thriving developer community on <Link to={`https://slack.growthbook.io?ref=docs-datasource-${slug}`}>Slack</Link> that you can reach out to in order to get your implementation working.

                We are a small open source company, so when you do, please consider contributing back to the community by <Link to="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-docs">creating this page</Link>.
