You must first create a Service Account in Mixpanel under your [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project#serviceaccounts).

To add the datasource in GrowthBook, you will need:

1.  The service account username
2.  The service account secret
3.  Your project id (found on the Project Settings Overview page)

You can find a more detailed walkthrough for setting up Mixpanel as your Event Tracker [here](/app/event-trackers/mixpanel)
