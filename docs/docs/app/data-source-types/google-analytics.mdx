**Note:** The Google Analytics data source only supports older Universal Analytics properties. If you are using Google Analytics v4 property, you need to [setup a BigQuery export](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238) and use that as the data source instead.

Because of Universal Analytics tracking limitations, a user can only be in a single experiment at a time. We highly recommend using a more full-featured data source for serious A/B testing.

We require 4 things to query the Universal Analytics API:

1.  OAuth Authorization
2.  View ID (found in Admin -> View Settings)
3.  Custom Dimension Index
4.  Custom Dimension Delimiter (defaults to `:`)

When tracking experiment views, the custom dimension value must be formatted as `{experiment-key}{delimiter}{variation-index}`. For example: `my-test:0` for the control and `my-test:1` for the 1st variation.

You can find more information [here](/app/event-trackers/GA-universal-analytics) on how to set up Google Analytics UAas your event-tracker.
