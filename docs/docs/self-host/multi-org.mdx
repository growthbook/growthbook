# Multi-Org

For self-hosted users, we provide the ability to manage multiple organizations in your GrowthBook instance.

Using our Admin settings page, you can view all organizations, create a new one, and manage the members for each organization.

Following the two steps below will enable you to access the Admin settings page and manage multiple organizations.

## Enabling Multi-Org

Before starting your GrowthBook instance, be sure to set the following environment variable as shown:

- `ALLOW_SELF_ORG_CREATION=true`

## Elevate to Super Admin

To access the Admin settings page, you'll need to elevate your user account to be a 'super admin'.

Currently, the way to do this is to set `superAdmin: true` on your corresponding user row in the MongoDB instance used by GrowthBook.
