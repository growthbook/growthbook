# Self Hosting GrowthBook

GrowthBook consists of a NextJS front-end, an ExpressJS API, and a Python stats engine. Everything is bundled together in a single [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/growthbook/growthbook).

In addition to the app itself, you will also need a MongoDB instance (or MongoDB compatible database) to store login credentials, cached experiment results, and metadata.

:::tip Don't want to install or host the app yourself?

<a href="https://app.growthbook.io">GrowthBook Cloud</a> is a fully managed version that's free to get started with.
:::

## Quick Start

You can use **docker compose** to get started quickly:

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mongo:
    image: "mongo:latest"
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - mongodata:/data/db
  growthbook:
    image: "growthbook/growthbook:latest"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "3100:3100"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:password@mongo:27017/growthbook?authSource=admin
    volumes:
      - uploads:/usr/local/src/app/packages/back-end/uploads
volumes:
  uploads:
  mongodata:
```

Then, just run `docker compose up -d` to start everything and view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

:::caution Use of mongo image
The use of the mongo image within the docker-compose.yml is meant to quickly get a dev or staging environment up and running.
For production you may want to use a more scalable and stable solution (ie. AWS DocumentDB, Google Cloud MongoDB Atlas, Azure Cosmos DB for Mongo, etc.)
:::

We also offer an official Helm chart for deploying GrowthBook on Kubernetes. See the [Kubernetes Self-Hosting Guide](/self-host/kubernetes) for more details.

## Production

We have a dedicated guide for [Self-Hosting GrowthBook in Production](/self-host/production) that covers best practices for security, scaling, performance, and more.

## Docker Tags

The `latest` tag is updated with every commit to the main branch. We run this tag in GrowthBook Cloud, so it's generally safe for production, but may occasionally have minor bugs.

We periodically create stable release tags (e.g. `4.1.0`) if you prefer to have more control over updates. Check out the [Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/releases) for a list of releases with detailed release notes.

Lastly, if you need to reference the image for a specific git commit for any reason, you can use the git shorthash tag (e.g. `git-41278e9`).
