# Self Hosting GrowthBook

GrowthBook consists of a NextJS front-end, an ExpressJS API, and a Python stats engine. Everything is bundled together in a single [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/growthbook/growthbook).

In addition to the app itself, you will also need a MongoDB instance to store login credentials, cached experiment results, and metadata.

:::tip
Don't want to install or host the app yourself? <a href="https://app.growthbook.io">GrowthBook Cloud</a> is a fully managed
version that's free to get started.

## Installation

You can use **docker-compose** to get started quickly:

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  mongo:
    image: "mongo:latest"
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  growthbook:
    image: "growthbook/growthbook:latest"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "3100:3100"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:password@mongo:27017/growthbook?authSource=admin
    volumes:
      - uploads:/usr/local/src/app/packages/back-end/uploads
volumes:
  uploads:
```

Then, just run `docker-compose up -d` to start everything and view the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Docker Tags

Builds are published automatically from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) main branch. The most recent commit is tagged with `latest`.

GitHub Releases are also tagged using SemVer (e.g. `0.2.1`).

If you need to reference the image for a specific git commit for any reason, you can use the git shorthash tag (e.g. `git-41278e9`).

## Updating to Latest

If you are using docker-compose, and assuming you specify the growthbook container with `:latest`, you can update with:

```bash
docker-compose pull growthbook
docker-compose stop growthbook
docker-compose up -d growthbook
```
