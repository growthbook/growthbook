# Introduction

GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing built for data teams, engineers, and product managers.
It's great whether you're looking to just analyze experiment results or looking to make it easier to deploy code.

## Our Goals

Companies invest thousands of hours building internal tools for feature flagging and experimentation (A/B testing). They do this to run these systems on their own infrastructure, utilize their own data, and ensure deep integration with their code.

GrowthBook gives data, engineering, and product teams the power of a customizable platform without needing to build it themselves.

- We believe that **feature flagging** is the best way to release features, and **A/B testing** is the best way to measure their impact.

- We believe A/B testing should sit on top of your **existing data and metrics**, wherever they live and however they are defined.

- We believe in **data transparency**. See the SQL behind every query, export results as a Jupyter notebook, and view our [stats engines on GitHub](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/tree/main/packages/stats).

- We are fanatical about **performance**. Our [SDKs](/lib) are crazy fast, lightweight, and evaluate everything locally with no network requests.

- We believe in **open source**. GrowthBook is open source and free to use. You can run it on your own infrastructure or use our hosted version.

- We believe in **privacy & security**. We don't collect any data about your users, and you can run GrowthBook on your own infrastructure.

- We believe good ideas come from everywhere. GrowthBook gives you feature flags, making it easy to **test everything** and seamlessly integrate experimentation into your process.
