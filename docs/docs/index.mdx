# Introduction

GrowthBook is the most popular open-source platform for feature flagging and experimentation. It's designed to help teams deliver better software faster by making it easy to test and roll out new features.

## Our Goals

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours building their own feature flagging and experimentation platforms in-house.

We want to give all companies the flexibility and power of these in-house platforms without needing to build it themselves.

- We believe that **feature flagging** is the best way to release code, and **experimentation** is the best way to measure its impact on your users.

- We believe experimentation should sit on top of your **existing data and metrics**, wherever they live and however they are defined.

- We believe in **data transparency**. See the SQL behind every query, export results as a Jupyter notebook, and view our [stats engines on GitHub](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/tree/main/packages/stats).

- We are fanatical about **performance**. Our [SDKs](/lib) are crazy fast, lightweight, and evaluate everything locally with no network requests.

- We believe in **open source**. GrowthBook is open source and free to use. The exact same code that powers our Cloud platform is available for you to run entirely on your own infrastructure.

- We believe in **privacy & security**. We don't collect any data about your users, and you can run GrowthBook on your own infrastructure entirely behind a firewall.
