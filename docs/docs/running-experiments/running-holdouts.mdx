Holdout experiments (or simply "holdouts") measure the long-term impact of features by maintaining a control group that doesn't receive new functionality. While most users experience your latest features and improvements, a small percentage remains on the original version, providing a baseline to measure cumulative effects over time.

Learn more about holdouts in our [Knowledge Base](/kb/experiments/holdouts).

## How Holdouts Work in GrowthBook

In GrowthBook, users in the holdout treatment group receive the same experience as the general population: they participate in experiments, receive feature releases, and see all your latest changes. The holdout control group, however, stays on the baseline experience.

This approach measures the cumulative impact of all changes over time by comparing the general population to the holdout control group.

## Creating a Holdout

![Add Holdout](/images/holdouts-add-modal.png)

1. Navigate to **Experiments** â†’ **Holdouts** and click **Add Holdout**

2. Configure your holdout settings:

- **Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `q1-2025-product-holdout`)
- **Holdout Size**: Defaults to 5% (meaning 5% of users remain in the control group)
- **Description**: Document the purpose and scope of your holdout
- **Key Metric**: Select a metric to track the impact of the holdout

3. Click **Start Holdout** to begin

### Adding Experiments to a Holdout

![Add Holdout to an experiment](/images/holdouts-experiment-with-holdout.png)

Once created, you can use your holdout in new experiments:

1. When creating a new experiment, you'll see a **Holdout** field
2. Your active holdout will selected in the dropdown by default
3. Complete the rest of your experiment setup normally

The experiment will run as usual, with the holdout tracking long-term cumulative effects in the background.

## Holdout Lifecycle

### Active Period

During the active period (typically a quarter), you'll:

- Continue adding new experiments to the holdout
- Launch features as normal
- Let the holdout accumulate data on cumulative impact

### Analysis Period

After your planned duration, transition to the analysis period:

1. **Stop adding new experiments**: The holdout enters analysis mode where no new experiments can be added
2. **Extended measurement**: Continue measuring for 2-4 weeks to capture delayed effects and reduce statistical noise
3. **Dynamic lookback window**: GrowthBook automatically applies a lookback window based on when each experiment was added, ensuring clean measurement periods

During analysis, the system:

Retains existing user assignments to avoid rebucketing
Applies the appropriate lookback window to exclude results from before the analysis period
Uses the minimum of the metric's lookback window and the analysis lookback window for each metric

### Understanding Holdout Results

Holdout results show the cumulative impact of all features and experiments included during the holdout period:

- **Positive lift**: Your combined changes improved metrics beyond the baseline
- **Negative or neutral lift**: Consider whether individual wins masked broader negative effects
- **Metric-specific impacts**: Different metrics may show varying long-term effects

The analysis compares your general population (who received all features) against the holdout control group (who remained on the baseline), revealing the true long-term value of your product changes.
