Holdout experiments (or simply "holdouts") measure the long-term impact of features by maintaining a control group that doesn't receive new functionality. While most users experience your latest features and improvements, a small percentage remains on the original version, providing a baseline to measure cumulative effects over time.

Learn more about holdouts in our [Knowledge Base](/kb/experiments/holdouts).

## How Holdouts Work in GrowthBook

In GrowthBook, units (e.g. users) in the holdout group are withheld from new features, experiments, and bandits. Units not in the holdout group will: participate in experiments, receive feature releases, and see all your latest changes. A subset of these units not in the holdout are used for measurement; these units are the same as the rest of the general population, we just select a sub-sample of units to serve as a comparison group for your holdout population.

This approach measures the cumulative impact of all changes over time by comparing the general population to the holdout group.
Under the hood, holdouts work by using prerequisites to divert a selected percentage of traffic away from features and experiments towards default values selected for your feature flags.
## Creating a Holdout

![Add Holdout](/images/holdouts-add-modal.png)

1. Navigate to **Experiments** â†’ **Holdouts** and click **Add Holdout**

2. Configure your holdout settings:

- **Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `q1-2025-product-holdout`)
- **Holdout Size**: Defaults to 5% (meaning 5% of traffic is placed in the holdout)
- **Description**: Document the purpose and scope of your holdout
- **Goal Metrics**: Select the key metrics for measuring cumulative impact

3. Click **Start Holdout** to begin

## Adding to a Holdout

Once your holdout is created, it is selected by default in new feature and experiment creation flows for the selected projects. Whenever someone creates a new feature, experiment, or bandit in a project the holdout was assigned to, a new field for "Holdout" is added to the creation flow and it defaults to the created holdout. If there are multiple holdouts assigned to an project (not recommended), then the feature or experiment creator will have to select the correct holdout to use, as only one can be used at a time per feature or experiment.


### Adding Experiments to a Holdout

![Add Holdout to an experiment](/images/holdouts-experiment-with-holdout.png)

Once created, you can use your holdout in new experiments:

1. When creating a new experiment, you'll see a **Holdout** field
2. Your active holdout for the given project will selected in the dropdown by default
3. Complete the rest of your experiment setup normally

The experiment will run as usual, with the holdout tracking long-term cumulative effects in the background.

## Holdout Lifecycle

### Active Period

During the active period (often a quarter), you'll:

- Continue adding new experiments to the holdout
- Launch features as normal
- Let the holdout accumulate data on cumulative impact

### Analysis Period

After your planned duration, transition to the analysis period:

1. **Stop adding new experiments**: The holdout enters analysis mode where no new experiments or features can be added
2. **Extended measurement**: Continue measuring for 2-4 weeks to capture delayed effects and reduce statistical noise
3. **Dynamic lookback window**: GrowthBook automatically applies a lookback window based on when each experiment was added, ensuring clean measurement periods

During analysis, the system:

Continues to split traffic into your holdout and general population groups
Applies the appropriate lookback window to exclude results from before the analysis period
Uses the minimum of the metric's lookback window (if it exists) and the analysis lookback window for each metric

### Understanding Holdout Results

Holdout results show the cumulative impact of all features and experiments included during the holdout period:

- **Positive lift**: Your combined changes improved metrics beyond the baseline
- **Negative or neutral lift**: Consider whether individual wins masked broader negative effects
- **Metric-specific impacts**: Different metrics may show varying long-term effects

The analysis compares your general population (who received all features and were experimented on) against the holdout control group (who remained on the baseline), revealing the true long-term value of your product changes.
