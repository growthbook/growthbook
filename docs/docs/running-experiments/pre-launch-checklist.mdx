## How to Create a Pre-Launch Checklist

Go to **Settings** &rarr; **General** and click **Edit Checklist**. From the menu, click **Add Your First Task**.

### Add a Pre-Defined Task

GrowthBook offers 5 pre-defined, common tasks:

1. Add a descriptive hypothesis for this experiment
2. Upload a screenshot for each variation of the experiment
3. Add a description for this experiment
4. Add this experiment to a project
5. Add at least 1 tag to this experiment

GrowthBook evaluates the status of these tasks automatically, checking off the task when the requirement is met.

### Add a Custom Task

To define a custom task, type the item in the text box and click **Add Task**. Add an optional URL to link to resources or documentation.

Click **Save** to enable the checklist on all experiments.

### Project-Level Checklists

You can also create a project-level checklist. This checklist will override the organization-level checklist for all experiments in the project.

To create a project-level checklist, go to **Settings** &rarr; **Projects** and select the project you want to create a checklist for. Here you can scroll to the `Experiment Settings` section and click `Create Checklist`.

If you change your mind, and you'd instead just like to use your organization's default checklist, you can delete the project-level checklist by clicking the `Delete Checklist` button.
