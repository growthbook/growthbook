# Experiment Templates

<CommercialFeature feature="templates" />

Experiment Templates provide standardized configurations for experiment creation across your team. By reducing setup overhead and eliminating common boilerplate, templates enable faster experiment initialization and consistency in experimental design.

## Creating Experiment Templates

Experiment Templates allow you to pre-configure:

- Experiment metadata and details
- Traffic allocation
- Targeting rules (saved groups, attributes, and prerequisites)
- Data source with goal, secondary, and guardrail metrics

- Use the overflow menu (⋮) to edit, duplicate, or delete a template.
- Click any template name to view a list of all experiments currently using that template.
- Changes to a template only apply to new experiments—existing experiments remain unchanged.
