# Configuring GrowthBook to work with Matomo

GrowthBook makes it easy to do A/B testing using Matomo as an event source. This guide shows you how to set up GrowthBook to work with self-hosted Matomo and the MySQL/MariaDB that it runs on.

## 1. Integrate GrowthBook's SDK with Matomo within your application

You can follow the SDK integration guides depending on your language. We need to add the `TrackingCallback` call
specifically for Matomo. For this guide, we'll use Javascript (Next.js).

Matomo lets you track custom events, and you can adjust the `Event Category`, `Event Action`, `Event Name`, and
`Event Value`. You can read more about the custom tracking call at [Matomo's documentation site](https://matomo.org/faq/reports/implement-event-tracking-with-matomo/).

:::caution Caveats with Matomo's event schema

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Event Category</strong> cannot contain any spaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      {" "}
      If <strong>Event Name</strong> is 0 or "0" it will record null.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Event Value</strong> must be an integer.
    </li>
  </ul>
:::

To work with the default data schema in GrowthBook, we will encode the following:

- `Event Category`: will have the value `ExperimentViewed` to isolate the exposure events.
- `Event Action`: will store the experiment key.
- `Event Name`: will store the variation id (with a prefix of `v` or some other string)

```ts
// Create a GrowthBook instance
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    window["_paq"] = window._paq || [];
    window._paq.push([
      "trackEvent",
      "ExperimentViewed",
      experiment.key,
      "v" + result.variationId,
    ]);
  },
});
```

:::info Event Name prefix for Matomo
We use the string prefix on the Event Name so that it is saved correctly, as `0`
saves as `null`, but `v0` works correctly. This prefix is stripped with the SQL
exposure query in step two.
:::

With that set, we need to load the user id into the GrowthBook user attributes. The following code shows how to do this with the Matomo anonymous `visitor ID`

```ts
// add the Matomo anonId when loaded
let visitor_id;
if ("_paq" in window) {
  _paq.push([
    function () {
      visitor_id = this.getVisitorId();
      growthbook.setAttributes({
        ...growthbook.getAttributes(),
        id: visitor_id,
      });
    },
  ]);
}
```

For Next.js, we would need to do this in the useEffect and also detect the window in case of a server side render:

```tsx
// Create a GrowthBook instance
const growthbook = new GrowthBook({
    trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
        if (window) {
            window["_paq"] = window._paq || [];
            window._paq.push(['trackEvent', 'ExperimentViewed', experiment.key, "v"+result.variationId]);
        }
    }
});

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    useEffect(() => {
        // Load feature definitions from API
        fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GROWTHBOOK_FEATURES_URL)
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((json) => {
                growthbook.setFeatures(json.features);
            });

        // TODO: replace with real targeting attributes
        growthbook.setAttributes({
            "company": "foo",
            "browser": "foo",
            "url": "foo"
        });

        // add the Matomo anonId when loaded
        let visitor_id;
        if("_paq" in window) {
            _paq.push([function () {
                visitor_id = this.getVisitorId();
                growthbook.setAttributes({ ...growthbook.getAttributes(), id: visitor_id });
            }]);
        }
    }, []);
    ...
```

## 2. Add the Data Source for Matomo

From within the GrowthBook application, navigate to the `Data Sources` page from within the `Analysis` section. Click on `add data source` and select `Matomo` from the list of event sources.

</MaxWidthImage>

After you select Matomo, you will be prompted to connect to your MySQL/Maria database.

</MaxWidthImage>

Once you've completed the connection GrowthBook will and then you can adjust some settings specific to your instance and how you implemented the Matomo tracking code.

</MaxWidthImage>

When you save, you'll have the experiment exposure queries for anonymous and user_id set for you.

</MaxWidthImage>

You can test running this query directly against your database. It should return a list of experiments exposure events.

You will still need to define the metrics you want to test against from the metrics settings.
