# A/B Testing with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and GrowthBook

This guide walks you through using GrowthBook with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for A/B testing. There are a few parts to
this, connecting GA4 to BigQuery, connecting GrowthBook to BigQuery, and then configuring GrowthBook to track correctly
with GA4.

## Configuring GrowthBook to use Google Analytics GA4 as a data source

GrowthBook connects to Google Analytics (GA4) via BigQuery. This process is straight forward, and outlined below.
You can also find Google's documentation on how to create this link [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238).

### 1. Create a BigQuery Project (if you don't have one)

If you don't have a BigQuery project, you'll need to create one. Go to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-1-project-list.png"
  alt="GA4 - BigQuery create project"
  style={{ width: 800, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Click on **_Create new project_** from the right and give your project a name.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-2-create-project.png"
  alt="GA4 - BigQuery create project"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Once created, you'll be redirected to the BigQuery dashboard.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-3-new-project.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 800, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

If you created a new project, the BigQuery API is automatically enabled. Otherwise, you'll need to enable it manually [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery)

:::note

If you are just testing GrowthBook with GA4 out, you can use the sandbox project that Google provides for free. When you create a new cloud project the sandbox should be automatically enabled. You can find more information about the sandbox [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox).

### 2. Connect Google Analytics to BigQuery

Log into your Google Analytics account and navigate to the Admin section. From there, make sure you have selected the right property, and scroll down to **_Product Links_** section. Click on the menu named **_BigQuery Links_**

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-4-link-to-bigquery-1.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 700, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Click on the **_Link_** button. This will open a menu that allows you select the project. Select on the **_Choose a BigQuery Project_** link.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-2.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery new project dashboard"
  style={{ width: 700, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Select the project you wish to send your GA4 data to:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-3.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery connect to project"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Then click **_next_**

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-4.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery connected to project"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

On the next step you'll be presented with some options about the connection.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-5.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery link options"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Here you can choose the frequency of data updates, either daily or streaming. To use Streaming, you'll need a BigQuery account with billing info added. Depending on your use case, daily updates may be sufficient.

On the final step you'll be asked to confirm your choices. When finished, you should see something like this, verifying that the connection was successful.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-6.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery successfully connected"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

And then your BigQuery link will show up on the listing page:

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-5-link-to-bigquery-7.png"
  alt="GA4 BigQuery successfully connected"
  style={{ width: 900, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

### 3. Configure BigQuery for GrowthBook

You'll need to give GrowthBook some permissions to your BigQuery project so that we can access the data. We have created a guide just for this, which you can find [here](https://docs.growthbook.io/guide/bigquery)

### 4. Connect GrowthBook to BigQuery

Within GrowthBook, navigate to the **_Analysis_** section, and then click on the **_Data Sources_** page. Add a new data source, and select **_Google Analytics (GA4)_**.

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-6-add-GA4-datasource.png"
  alt="GrowthBook connect to GA4"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

<img
  src="/images/guides/GA4-6-add-GA4-datasource2.png"
  alt="GrowthBook connect to GA4"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto 10px auto" }}
/>

Then add your BigQuery connection info. GrowthBook will pre-populate the SQL queries required to use your GA4 data. You
can also add a custom SQL query if you want to use a different table or filter the data in some way as you like.

:::note

While GrowthBook will pre-populate the SQL queries for you, you may need to adjust the experiment query to match your
data depending on the way you are tracking your experiments (see the **_trackingCallback_** below).

:::

Once connected, you'll be able to add any additional metrics or dimensions, and then you can use your GA4 data for your
experiments. You can use all your existing events and tracking- GrowthBook only requires one additional tracking call
when a user is exposed to an experiment.

## Running experiments with GrowthBook and GA4

With the data source connected, you can use the GrowthBook SDK run A/B tests. The SDK lets you run experiments where the
variations are defined in code, and controlled from UI. Once implemented, the SDK will do the random assignments and send
the experiment exposure event to GA4 based on the settings in the GrowthBook UI.

:::info

We do have a visual editor for creating experiments, but it is meant for simple experiments. Experiments that are more
complex are best created with a change in the code.

:::

### SDK integration for GA4

You can follow the guides on SDK integration for any of our supported languages [here](http://localhost:3200/lib/). The
only special case for GA4 is getting the **user Id** and/or **Client ID** attribute, and adjusting the `trackingCallback` to
send the experiment exposure event to GA4.

#### Using GA's Client ID

GA generates a **Client ID** (sometimes called a device Id) for each visitor, and then stores this unique ID in a cookie
(\_ga). There are a few ways to grab this Id from your code. Here are a few ways with Javascript:

```js
gtag('get', 'G-[your google property id]', 'client_id', (clientId) => {
  console.log(clientId)
});
```

or

```js
const clientId = document.cookie.match(/_ga=(.+?);/)[1].split('.').slice(-2).join(".")
```

You can read more about getting this ID [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20053949/how-to-get-the-google-analytics-client-id)

#### Using a User ID

If you have a custom **User Id** already, you can use this with GA4 instead (or as well) as the **Client Id**.
You can read Google's official instructions on how to pass a custom **User Id** [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-id?client_type=gtag).

:::info

A **User Id** in this case would be something you pass to GA4, not something GA4 generates for you. You can use this ID throughout your GA4 reports.

:::

#### Passing Attributes to the SDK

Once you have your **Client ID** and/or **User Id**, you can pass it to the GrowthBook SDK when you initialize it. For example:

```js
const gb = new GrowthBook({
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // Enable easier debugging during development
  enableDevMode: true,
  // Targeting attributes
  attributes: {
    clientId: clientId,
    userId: userId,
    country: "US",
    ...
  }
});
```

And then these id's can be used from the GrowthBook UI to target your experiments. You can add the attributes to the UI from the **_Features -> Attributes_** page.

#### Tracking experiment exposure

The only additional event required is when a user is exposed to an experiment. This is done by adding a GA4 custom event from inside the `trackingCallback` method. For example:

```js
const gb = new GrowthBook({
  apiHost: "https://cdn.growthbook.io",
  clientKey: "sdk-abc123",
  // Targeting attributes
  attributes: {
    clientId: gaUserId,
    userId: userId,
    country: country,
    ...
  },
  trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    // track using GA4
    if ("gtag" in window) {
      window.gtag("event", "experiment_viewed", {
        event_category: "experiment",
        experiment_id: experiment.key,
        variation_id: result.variationId,
        ...
      });
    } else {
      console.log("no gtag");
    }
  },
});
```

:::note

If your experiment is not firing the `trackingCallback` you can use our
[Chrome developer tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia)
to help you debug and make sure the user attributes are being set correctly.

:::

Implementing the experiment variations can be done with code with inline experiments, using the feature flags, or by
using our visual editor.
