# Amplitude Event Tracker Setup

## Exposure Tracking

For client side testing, you can fire a custom track event from the GrowthBook SDK's `trackingCallback` function, like so:

```js
 trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    amplitude.track('Experiment Viewed', {experimentId: experiment.key, variantId: result.key});
  }
```

You can also use Amplitudes own experiment javascript format:

```js
 trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    amplitude.track('$exposure', {flag_key: experiment.key, variant: result.key});
  }
```

You can read more about Amplitude's exposure event [here](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/experiment/general/exposure-tracking/)

## Integrating with Amplitude Data

For GrowthBook to integrate with Amplitude you first must export your Amplitude data to the data warehouse of your choice.
You can read more about it on [Amplitudes help pages](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/destinations/).

Currently, Amplitude supports exporting to Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, and S3 (and use Athena). Once you have set up a data export to one
of these destinations, you can connect GrowthBook to it.

:::note

GrowthBook won't automatically create SQL queries for Amplitude, but you can follow the general instructions below. If you need any help, [reach out to us](https://slack.growthbook.io) and we can help
