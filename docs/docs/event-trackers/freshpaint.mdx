# Freshpaint Event Tracker

## Event Tracker Setup

For JS, you can track the experiment exposure events by adding the following code the `trackingCallback` in the GrowthBook SDK.

```js
 trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    freshpaint.track('Experiment Viewed', {experimentId: experiment.key, variantId: result.key});
 }
```

## Data Source Setup

Freshpaint does not support direct data access, instead, to work with GrowthBook, you'll need to export your data to a
data warehouse. You can read about the supported data destinations [here](https://documentation.freshpaint.io/destinations/warehouses).
Freshpaint lets you export to BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, and Snowflake.

:::note Automatic SQL query creation

GrowthBook will attempt automatically create SQL queries for Freshpaint, but this may require adjustments. General
instructions for setting up SQL sources are below. If you need any help, [reach out to us](https://slack.growthbook.io) and we can help
