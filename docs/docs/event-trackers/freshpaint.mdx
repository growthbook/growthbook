# Freshpaint Event Tracker

## Event Tracker Setup

For JS, you can track the experiment exposure events by adding the following code the `trackingCallback` in the GrowthBook SDK.

```js
 trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
    freshpaint.track('Experiment Viewed', {experimentId: experiment.key, variantId: result.key});
 }
```

## Data Source Setup

Freshpaint does not support direct data access, instead, to work with GrowthBook, you'll need to export your data to a
data warehouse. You can read about the supported data destinations [here](https://documentation.freshpaint.io/destinations/warehouses).
Freshpaint lets you export to BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, and Snowflake.

:::note

GrowthBook will attempt automatically create SQL queries for Freshpaint, but this may require adjustments. General
instructions for setting up SQL sources are below. If you need any help, [reach out to us](https://slack.growthbook.io) and we can help
