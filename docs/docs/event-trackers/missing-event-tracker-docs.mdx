                Growthbook will modify its default sql settings to work as seamlessly as possible with {eventTracker}.  
                After choosing {eventTracker} as your data source and filling in the connection info, you can proceed with any modifications of your <Link to={`/app/datasources`}>configuration settings.</Link>

                Unfortunately a detailed guide for {eventTracker} has not been written yet. 
                However we do have a thriving developer community on <Link to={`https://slack.growthbook.io?ref=docs-event-tracker-${slug}`}>Slack</Link> that you can reach out to in order to get your implementation working.  Once you get your implementation working please consider contributing back to the community by <Link to="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-docs">creating this page</Link>.
