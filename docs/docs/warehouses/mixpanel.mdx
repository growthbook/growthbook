:::caution

Using Mixpanel as a direct datasource is not advised and has been placed in maintenance mode. This is because because Mixpanel has placed JQL, their query language, in [maintenance mode](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/jql-overview) themselves. Therefore, our integration is limited and may unexpectedly break as they wind down support for JQL.

In order to ensure long term compatibility with GrowthBook and to receive the full set of features available in GrowthBook, we suggest you set up an export to a data warehouse following [Mixpanel's documentation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/raw-data-export-api) and then use that separate data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery) as your Data Source in GrowthBook.

:::

You must first create a Service Account in Mixpanel under your [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project#serviceaccounts).

To add the datasource in GrowthBook, you will need:

1.  The service account username
2.  The service account secret
3.  Your project id (found on the Project Settings Overview page)
