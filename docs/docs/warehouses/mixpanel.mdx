:::caution

Using Mixpanel as a direct datasource is no longer supported. This is because because Mixpanel has placed JQL, their query language, in [maintenance mode](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/apps/jql).

In order to use Mixpanel with GrowthBook, we suggest you set up an export to a data warehouse following [Mixpanel's documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-pipelines) and then use that separate data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery) as your Data Source in GrowthBook.
