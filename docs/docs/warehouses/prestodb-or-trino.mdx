:::note

GrowthBook uses the presto-client-node library to connect to Prestodb or Trino. You can find more information about the library [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/presto-client).

:::

## Engine

This option lets you tell the client that your data source is `presto` or `trino`. For `trino` data sources, the connection
library adds additional compatibility information to work correctly with `trino` data sources. The default is `presto`.

## Authentication Options

### Basic Auth

If your Prestodb or Trino instance is configured with basic auth, you can provide the username and password in the connection
settings.

### Custom Auth

For custom authentication, GrowthBook will connect to your Prestodb or Trino instance using the provided HTTP Authorization
header with the provided string.

### None

If your Prestodb or Trino instance does not require authentication, or you are doing authentication based on IP or other
methods, you can select "None" in the connection settings. This is not recommended for Cloud instances of GrowthBook. In
these cases, the 'user' will be set to 'growthbook'.

## Host

The url to access your Prestodb or Trino instance. This should include the protocol (http or https).

## Port

Presto coordinator port. The default is 8080.

## Default Catalog and Schema

GrowthBook will create default queries using the catalog you provide here. If you update this value later, you
may have to update existing queries to use the new catalog.

## source

The source field is used to help identify where the connection to presto is coming from. By default, this is set to
'GrowthBook'.
