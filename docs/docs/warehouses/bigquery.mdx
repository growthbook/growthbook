# Configuring GrowthBook to work with BigQuery

This document outlines the steps needed to add your BigQuery database to GrowthBook.

## 1. Create a service account for GrowthBook

Within your [Google Cloud console account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), create a service account for GrowthBook to use

  alt="Create a new service account in BigQuery"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Create a service account name and account ID. On the next page you need to add 3 specific roles:

  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

On the Grant page, add two (read only) permissions roles:

- BigQuery Data Viewer
- BigQuery Job User

  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

On the final page when creating a service account, you can skip the optional fields.

You should see the new service account listed, without a `Key ID`. We need to add an access key to this account so the
credentials can be added to GrowthBook. Click on actions, and select `Manage Keys`.

/>

There are two ways to provide credentials to GrowthBook:

- Auto-discovery from environment variables or GCP metadata (only available when self-hosting)
- Upload a JSON key file for the service account

We're going to show how to do the JSON key file method. On the keys page, add a new key, and select JSON.

/>

<img
  src="/images/guides/bigquery-6-getjson-key3.png"
  alt="Get json key for service account"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

This will cause the JSON key to be downloaded to your computer.

## 2. Connect GrowthBook to BigQuery

From the Analysis -> Data Source page, click on add new data source and select the event tracker you're using. If your event tracker is not listed, or you're using something custom, click on the "Custom" button at the bottom.

Selecting an event tracker here will pre-populate the experiment exposure query which is need to determine which user saw which experiment
variation. Depending on your needs, you may still need to adjust these queries to match your specific schema.

<img

  alt="Add BigQuery to GrowthBook"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Select BigQuery as the data source type.

<img
  src="/images/guides/bigquery-7-add-datasource2.png"
  alt="Add BigQuery to GrowthBook"
  style={{ width: 500, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Add the names you'd like to use, and select the JSON key file that was downloaded earlier.

Although the `Default Project Name` and `Default Dataset` is not required, it is helpful to set this to the correct
values for your database. You can get the name of these fields from the [Google Cloud explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). You will see the top level
project name, and when expanded, find the dataset which has your experiment exposure table (which will be `experiment_viewed` if you use Segment or Rudderstack).

<img
  src="/images/guides/bigquery-8-getdefault-names.png"
  alt="Get default project name and default dataset"
  style={{ width: 300, margin: "0 auto 10px" }}
/>

When you click save, GrowthBook will test the connection to make sure the credentials are correct. If the connection is successful, you should see a success message on the next page.

## Monitoring GrowthBook query cost

Whenever we query your BigQuery database we add `{ integration: "growthbook" }` as a label to the query job to make it easy for you to monitor cost or filter GrowthBook query jobs by label for other use cases.
