import CommercialFeature from '@site/src/components/CommercialFeature';

We support multiple [account identifier](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html) formats when connecting to Snowflake. An example account identifier is `xy12345.us-east-2.aws`.

## Self-Hosting

If you are self-hosting GrowthBook, you can send queries to Snowflake through an Authenticated Proxy.

To enable this, set a `SNOWFLAKE_PROXY` environment variable in your GrowthBook container. Here is an example:

```
SNOWFLAKE_PROXY=http://username:password@proxyserver.company.com:80
```

## Enabling Data Pipeline Mode

<CommercialFeature feature="pipeline-mode" description="Pipeline mode can reduce query costs if you grant the GrowthBook service account write permissions in your data warehouse." />
