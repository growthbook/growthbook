GrowthBook supports connecting to databases through an ODBC driver. Currently, only **Apache Impala** is supported. If you would like to see support for other databases please reach out to us.

ODBC connections are only supported for self-hosted GrowthBook instances.

## Setting up ODBC

### 1. Install ODBC Driver

First download and install a Linux ODBC driver for your database. For example, the [Cloudera Impala ODBC driver](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/odbc/2-6-11.html).

Locate the installed driver `.so` file. You will need this path in the next step.

### 2. Configure ODBC

Next, create `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` files if they don't exist yet. Look at the driver's documentation for the exact configuration needed. Below is an example configuration for the Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala.

```ini
# odbcinst.ini
[Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala]
Description=Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala
Driver=/opt/cloudera/impalaodbc/lib/64/libclouderaimpalaodbc64.so
```

```ini
# odbc.ini
[ImpalaDSN]
Driver=Cloudera ODBC Driver for Impala
Host=impala-host.example.com
Port=21050
Database=default
AuthMech=0
```

Take note of the DSN name you used in the `odbc.ini` file (`ImpalaDSN` in this example).

### 3. Mount Files in Docker

When starting GrowthBook in Docker, mount the driver directory, `odbc.ini`, and `odbcinst.ini` files into the container. For example:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /etc/odbc.ini:/etc/odbc.ini \
  -v /etc/odbcinst.ini:/etc/odbcinst.ini \
  -v /opt/cloudera/impalaodbc/lib:/opt/cloudera/impalaodbc/lib/64/ \
  growthbook/growthbook
```

### 4. Add the Data Source to GrowthBook

In GrowthBook, go to the Data Sources page and add a new data source. Select "ODBC" as the type and pick your driver (Impala is the only option currently).

The only required field is the `DSN`, which should match the DSN name you used in the `odbc.ini` file (`ImpalaDSN` in the example above).

## Configuring the Data Source

Once you have added the data source, you can customize the settings and default SQL to match your data schema. See the [Data Sources documentation](/app/datasources) for more information.
