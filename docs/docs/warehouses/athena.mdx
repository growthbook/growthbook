Unlike other database engines with their own user management system, Athena uses IAM for authentication.

We recommend creating a new role with readonly permissions for GrowthBook. The managed [Quick Sight Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy.html) is a good starting point.

For the S3 results url, we recommend naming your bucket with the prefix `aws-athena-query-results-`

There are two ways to provide AWS credentials to GrowthBook:

1. Auto-discovery from environment variables or instance metadata (only available when self-hosting)
2. Enter the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey in the GrowthBook UI when connecting to the data source
