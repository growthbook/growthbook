            <p>
                When setting up {datasource} to work with Growthbook, remember it's important to create read-only users with minimal permissions, ideally granting only read access to the relevant data tables that need to be aggregated.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using GrowthBook Cloud (app.growthbook.io), make sure to whitelist the ip address <code>52.70.79.40</code> if applicable.
            </p>

                Unfortunately there isn't a specific guide for setting up {datasource} for Growthbook yet. 
                However, if you encounter any difficulties while setting up your data source, you can seek assistance from our active developer community on <Link to={`https://slack.growthbook.io?ref=docs-datasource-${slug}`}>Slack</Link>.  
                They can help you troubleshoot and ensure your implementation is successful.
                Once you've successfully set up {datasource} according to best practices, we encourage you to contributing to the community by <Link to="https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-docs">creating improved documentation for {datasource}</Link>.
