# Security

GrowthBook is built with security in mind, and have made architectural decisions to ensure that your GrowthBook
instance can be as secure as possible.

## Data Security

GrowthBook only stores account information for your users with GrowthBook accounts (email, and name).
For feature flagging, evaluations typically happen within the SDK, and so none of your users information
is sent to GrowthBook. For experiment reporting, we connect to your data warehouse to pull the
assignment/exposure and metric information. This data remains in your data warehouse, GrowthBook only
stores the aggregate results, such as the total number of users exposed to each variation, and other
statistical information. No PII is stored or transferred to GrowthBook with the experimentation reports.

There are some ways where personal information may be stored or exposed with GrowthBook. If you are using
GrowthBook on the client side of your application, the rules about how each feature will be exposed
to your users is publicly accessible by inspecting network requests. Normally these rules contain no personal information, but if
you are targeting to a specific user or set of users, than this information may be visible to malicious
users. If you are using GrowthBook on the server side, this information is not exposed to the client.
For these reasons, targeting based on PII when using GrowthBook client side is not recommended.

If you have to target based on PII on the client side, GrowthBook has some ways to make this secure. You
can use hashed attributes, where the values are hashed before sending, or you can use encrypted
attributes, where the payload is encrypted before sending to the client. Keep in mind that encrypted SDK
endpoints will have to payload decrypted before use, and that means if you are using it client side, that
it is possible for a malicious actor to see the decrypted payload. You can enable encryption when setting
up the SDK, and you can select an attribute as 'hashed' when creating the attribute.

Finally, to avoid these issues, you can also use 'remote evaluations' to evaluate
flags based on sensitive information without exposing it, even on client side. With remote evaluations, the SDK will send the
user attribute to your server (or ours), and then that attribute is matched against the rules, and then
the state of the feature is returned, without revealing the targeting rules to the client. The downside
of this approach is that each users requires a network request to evaluate the feature, which can slow
down your application.

## Data Access

GrowthBook requires read only access to your data warehouse. This connection information is kept encrypted.
To help protect access to your data warehouse through the GrowthBook UI, you can use permissions. You can
assign users who can edit the connection info, or who can edit SQL queries for the assignment or metric queries.

Data sources can also be scoped to projects. This means that only users who have access to the project and have
the right permission levels can edit those queries. If you require more separation of your data, you can create
separate cloud organizations, or run GrowthBook in multi-tenant mode when you self-host (available as part of
GrowthBook Enterprise). With this, you can have separate GrowthBook organization running from one central
GrowthBook instance. Each organization will have its own data source, metrics, and users.
There is a super-admin account type that can manage users across organizations.

## Infrastructure Security

GrowthBook Cloud is hosted on AWS, in a multi-tenant environment. We use industry standard security
to ensure that your data is secure. If you require additional security, we also offer self-hosted options.
When you self-host, no data leaves your infrastructure. We do have anonymous usage tracking enabled by
default, but this can be disabled (see [self-hosted](/self-host)).

## Self-hosted deployments

GrowthBook can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. If self-hosting, we recommend that you keep GrowthBook behind a
firewall, and accessible via a VPN. See [self-hosting](/self-host) for more information. GrowthBook should
also be regularly updated to ensure that you are running the latest version with the latest security patches.
GrowthBook updates are backwards compatible, and can be easily applied with a single command. See
[updating GrowthBook](/self-host#updating-to-latest)

Before deploying GrowthBook in production, we recommend that you make sure you've configured GrowthBook correctly:

- Change the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable. This is used to sign the JWT tokens used for authentication, and needs to be changed from the default.
- Change the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. This is used to encrypt sensitive data, and should be set to a long random string.
- Set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`. This will enable add additional optimizations and disable some debugging features.
