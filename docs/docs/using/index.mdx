# Guide on using GrowthBook

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, businesses of all sizes rely on A/B testing to make data-driven decisions.
A/B testing, also known as split testing, has come a long way from a simple tool to optimize websites,
and is often used as a powerful tool to determine the impact of any changes to your application.
By measuring how your user behavior and engagement changes in a controlled manner, you can
determine causally if your hypothesis is correct, and make informed data-driven decisions that improve
user experience, increase conversions, and drive growth.

This document is intended to be an open source and continuously updated guide to A/B testing.
Whether you're a seasoned expert at running experiments, or just starting out, this book will provide
you with the knowledge and skills you need to run a successful A/B testing program, with a specific
focus on GrowthBook, an open source feature flagging and A/B testing platform.

In the following chapters, we'll start with an overview of what A/B testing is, and familiarize you with the
terms that are commonly used. We'll cover the basics of statistical significance, sample size, and other
key concepts that are essential for understanding A/B testing.
Next, we'll cover the best practices for running an A/B test, followed by some of the common mistakes
and pitfalls that can affect experiment programs. Finally, we'll go beyond individual A/B tests and talk about how to run an experimentation program,
and then specifics of how to do this well with GrowthBook.

We hope after reading this guide, you'll understand that A/B testing is a critical tool for determining
causal impact of the changes you make, as well as optimizing flows. By making informed data-driven
