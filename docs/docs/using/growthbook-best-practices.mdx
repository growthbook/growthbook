# GrowthBook Best Practices

## Organization

As you scale up your usage of GrowthBook and start running many experiments, keeping everything
organized and easy to find is important. GrowthBook includes a number of organizational structures
to help you scale.

### Organizations

The organization is the highest level structure within GrowthBook. In an organization contains
everything within your GrowthBook instance: users, data sources, metrics, features, etc. For both
cloud and self-hosted users, it is possible for users to join multiple organizations. Users can
belong to multiple organizations, but each organization is otherwise entirely independent of the
others. For some, complete isolation of the teams or subdivisions within the company may be desired.
For example, if your company has two or more largely independent products (e.g., Google has Search
and Google Docs), you can set up multiple organizations per product.

For self-hosted enterprise users, we support multi-organization mode, which also comes with a
super-admin account type that can manage users across organizations.

### Environments

In GrowthBook, you can create as many Environments as you need for the feature flags and override rules.
Environments are meant to separate how your feature flags and override rules are deployed. Each environment
can have one or more SDK API endpoints, specified when you create the SDK, allowing you to differentiate
the override rules. For example, you might have environments for “Staging”, “QA”, and “Production”. While
testing the feature, you can set specific rules to on the "development" or "QA" environment, and when
you're ready, you can move applicable rules to the "production" environment.

You can add an arbitrary number of environments from the SDK Connections → Environments page.

### Projects

Within an organization, you can create projects. Projects can help isolate the view of GrowthBook to
just the sections that apply for that GrowthBook user. Projects are a great way to organizationally
separate features, metrics, experiments, and even data sources by team or product feature. For example,
you could have a project “front-end” and one for “back-end”, or by team like “Growth” and “API”. Unlike
separate organizations, projects can share data. Projects are managed from the Settings → Projects page.
between them.

A use case for using projects is if you have divisions within your product but a centralized data source.
We typically see projects used per team or per project within your organization. For example, if you have
a mobile app and a website that shares users, but the code bases are different, you will want to create
two projects: a _mobile_ project and a _web_ project.

Each of the items within GrowthBook can be assigned to multiple projects. You can have a data source that
is part of the ‘mobile’ and ‘web’ projects but not to a ‘marketing’ project. That data source will not be
available for users in the 'marketing' project.

To help keep feature payloads smaller, the SDK endpoint where the feature definitions are returned
can be scoped to each project. If using Projects based on features or area of your product, you can
use this feature to only return features which pertain to that area. For example, with our “mobile”
and “website” example, you can add the project scope to only return features for the project as these
are likely to use different code than the other, and you don’t want to expose features unnecessarily.

One advantage of using projects is that you can adjust permissions and even some statistical settings per
project- users can have no access to a project or, inversely, have no general permissions but add a project
permission so they can work within their project. If a team prefers to use a frequentist statistical model,
this can be adjusted per project.

### Tags

Another way to organize GrowthBook is with _tags_. With tags, you can quickly filter lists, and select
metrics. For example, if you tagged all experiments to do with your checkout flow with the tag “checkout”,
you can quickly see this in the list by clicking on ‘filter by tags’ on the experiment list. Tags can be
color-coded and managed from our Settings → Tags page. You can add multiple tags per item you are tagging.

Metrics with tags can be used to quickly add all those metrics to an experiment. When creating an
experiment or editing the metrics, there is a section titled “Select metric by tag” which will let you add
all the metrics by the tag name to both guardrail and goal metrics. This is useful if you want to use a
standard set of goal metrics or guardrail metrics for your experiments.

Tags are often used to mark sub-features of your product; for example, if you have an e-commerce
website, you might want to tag features or experiments with the area they affect, like ‘_pricing_,’
‘_product page_,’ or ‘_checkout_.’

### Naming

Another organizing principle you can use is the naming of your experiments and features. Because GrowthBook
makes it easy to quickly search the list of features and flags, using naming conventions can be an
effective way to organize your project.

We’ve seen several strategies be successful here, but as a general rule, you’ll want to be as specific as possible
with naming features and experiments. For example, you can use &lt;project scope>\_&lt;project name> or the year,
quarter, or section plus the name of the experiment, eg: “23-Q4 New user registration modal“ or “23-Team3 Simplified checkout flow”.
This lets you quickly see when the experiment was run or which team worked on it.

### Hygiene & Archiving

As the number of features and experiments grow, you will want to remove past items that are no longer
relevant. Within GrowthBook you can archive and delete. **Deleting** something will permanently remove
items from GrowthBook. **Archived** items in GrowthBook won’t be deleted, but they are removed from
the main part of the UI and not available for adding to new experiments (for archived metrics). Archived
items can also be restored at any time. These methods help you keep your UI clean and relevant.

### Source of Truth

If you run an experimentation program for a long enough time, you’ll find yourself with an experiment
idea that seems really familiar, and people will wonder, “Didn’t we already test this?” If you don’t
have a central repository for all your experiment results, it can be difficult to find if you did test
this previously, and even if you did, if what you tested was similar enough to the new idea not to have
to test it again.

GrowthBook is designed to help with this by creating a central source for the features you’ve launched
and the experiments you’ve run. To help facilitate this, GrowthBook has created a number of features to
help you capture meta information.

### Meta information

Features and experiments can all have metadata attached to them. The purpose of this is to help capture
all the meta-information around a feature or experiment that might help contextualize it for posterity
and help capture the institutional knowledge that your program generates. This is also very helpful when
new members join your team, so they don’t just suggest ideas you’ve run many times already.

For experiments, you should capture the original idea, any screenshots of similar products, and, most
importantly, capture images/screenshots of the control and variants for the experiment. Quite often,
someone will suggest an idea you’ve run previously. In these cases, it is important to be able to find
out what exactly you tested previously - it's possible that the new idea is slightly different, or you
may decide that it is the same and try testing another idea, or you could decide that your product is
substantially different, and the same idea may be worth testing again. To make this decision, it is
important to capture not just the experiment results but the broader context of what your product
looked like at the time and the test variants.

Getting your team to document is always a challenge. To help with this, GrowthBook takes two approaches.
The first is to make is super easy to add documentation directly in the platform you’re already using
for the experiment. Secondly, we added launch checklists, which can require that certain files be filled
before your team is able to start an experiment.
