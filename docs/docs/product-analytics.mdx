# Product Analytics

Product Analytics in GrowthBook allows you to build general-purpose dashboards that help you understand your product performance, user behavior, and business metrics using the existing data connections and metrics you've already configured for experiments.

## With GrowthBook's Product Analytics you can:

- **Create custom business dashboards** - Monitor KPIs, user engagement, and product performance
- **Explore your data** - Use SQL Explorer to run ad-hoc queries and discover insights
- **Build metric visualizations** - Create visualizations from your existing metrics without running experiments
- **Share stakeholder reports** - Share curated views of your data with non-technical team members (Shareable dashboards require an Enterprise subscription)

:::note

Product Analytics dashboards are available for organizations with Pro or Enterprise subscriptions. Pro organizations can create an unlimited number of private dashboards, while Enterprise organizations can create an unlimited number of dashboards and have access to the full suite of sharing options.
