# Product Analytics

Build **general-purpose dashboards** to better understand your product's performance, user behavior, and key business metrics.

// TODO: Add a screenshot of a dashboard here

## Key Capabilities

- **Build Custom Dashboards:** Monitor KPIs, user engagement, and overall product health using a unified view
- **Explore Your Data**: Use **SQL Explorer** to run custom queries directly against your data warehouse for deeper, on-the-fly analysis
- **Visualize Existing Metrics**: Generate visualizations from your existing metrics without launching an experiment
- **Share Reports with Stakeholders**: Create curated views of your data for non-technical team members and collaborate seamlessly across the organization. (Enterprise only)

:::note

Product Analytics dashboards are available for organizations with **Pro** or Enterprise subscriptions**. Pro organizations can create unlimited private dashboards, while Enterprise organizations gain access to the full suite of sharing and collaboration options.

## Creating a Product Analytics Dashboard

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Product Analytics**
2. Click **Create Dashboard** to start building
3. Give your dashboard a descriptive name and configure sharing settings

### Dashboard Settings

When creating a dashboard, you can configure the following properties:

- **Name**: A descriptive title for your dashboard
- **Projects**: Associate the dashboard with specific projects for better organization
- **Auto-update**: Enable automatic data refreshes to keep dashboards current
- **View Access**: Control who can see the dashboard (**Organization** members or **Private**)
- **Edit Access**: Control who can modify the dashboard

## Dashboard Blocks

Product Analytics dashboards are built from three core block types, each serving a specific purpose:

### Markdown Blocks

Use formatted text, images, and links to provide context and narrative for your data. Perfect for:

- **Introductions and Explanations**: Set the stage for the data being presented
- **Key Findings**: Highlight insights and recommendations
- **Contextual Links**: Provide links to related documentation or resources
- **Visual Elements**: Align dashboards with your organization's design and brand

### SQL Explorer Blocks

Run custom SQL queries against your data warehouse and create visualizations. Ideal for:

- **Ad-hoc Analysis**: Explore data that isn't captured in standard metrics
- **Custom Reports**: Build specific views for unique business needs
- **Data Validation**: Verify data quality and investigate anomalies
- **Complex Joins**: Combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis

:::note
SQL Explorer only allows read-only SELECT queries. Write operations are prevented for security.

### Metric Explorer Blocks

Create visualizations from your existing metrics without running experiments. Great for:

- **KPI Monitoring**: Track key business metrics over time
- **Trend Analysis**: Understand how metrics change over different time periods
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare metrics across different segments or timeframes
- **Baseline Reporting**: Establish benchmarks and monitor performance

## Use Cases by Team

These are just a few examples of the dashboards you can create:

| Team | Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Leadership** | Revenue, growth, user acquisition/retention, and key business performance indicators |
| **Product** | Feature adoption/usage, user engagement patterns, and A/B test results |
| **Marketing** | Campaign performance, conversion funnels, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) |
| **Operations** | System performance, error rates, reliability, and technical health indicators |

## Best Practices for Sharing and Collaboration

- **Organize by Project**: Use project-based access to control who sees what
- **Enable Auto-Updates**: Keep dashboards current with automatic refreshes
- **Provide Context**: Use **Markdown Blocks** to include explanations of methodology, data sources, and findings.
- **Share with Organization Members**: Make dashboards accessible to your team. (Enterprise only)

Product Analytics transforms GrowthBook from an experimentation platform into a comprehensive analytics solution, giving you the tools to understand your product performance and make data-driven decisions across your entire organization.
