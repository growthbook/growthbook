## What are holdout experiments?

Holdout experiments (or simply "holdouts") measure the long-term impact of features by maintaining a control group that doesn't receive new functionality. While most users experience your latest features and improvements, a small percentage remains on the original version, providing a baseline to measure cumulative effects over time.

## Who uses holdouts?

Major tech companies often use holdouts to measure both individual feature impact and overall product evolution. However, we recommend that teams of all sizes use holdouts at some level, even if only occasionally. Starting with a simple, single-feature holdout helps you understand the feature's long-term impact and reveals how experiment effects persist at your company.

## Why run a holdout?

- **Measure long-term impact**: The impact of features changes over time, as does user behavior, and running a holdout experiment for an extended period will help you understand these effects.
- **Understand cumulative effects**: Features interact in unexpected ways, and these interactions shift over time. Holdouts capture the combined impact of multiple changes, revealing synergies and conflicts that individual experiments miss..

## Why wouldn't I want to run a holdout?

- **User experience trade-offs**: Holdouts require some users to miss out on improvements and new features while serving as the control group.
- **Technical overhead**: Holdouts require you to maintain feature flags in your codebase for their duration.
- **Authentication considerations**: Holdouts work best for logged-in experimentation, but can still be useful with anonymous traffic.

## Can I run a holdout experiment in GrowthBook?
