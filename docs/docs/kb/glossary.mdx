**A**

[A/A Experiment](/kb/experiments/aa-tests): A/A testing is a form of A/B testing where two identical versions of a product or design are tested against each other to check the consistency of the testing platform and methodology.

[A/B Experiment](/using/fundamentals#anatomy-of-an-ab-test): A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or other product to determine which one performs better by splitting traffic between the two versions and measuring their performance using statistical analysis.

[Analysis attribute](/lib/python#attributes): Analysis attribute in GrowthBook is a user-specific attribute (like user id, device id, etc.) used for segmenting and analyzing experiment results based on different user characteristics.

[Approval Flow](/features/features/approval-flows): Approval flow is a feature in GrowthBook that requires changes to features to be reviewed and approved before they are published, reducing errors and ensuring changes have been viewed by someone else in the organization.

[Assignment](/experiments#custom-assignment-or-3rd-party-experiments): Assignment in GrowthBook refers to the process of allocating users to different variations of an experiment, typically done using a consistent hashing algorithm to ensure the same user always gets the same variation given the same experiment settings.

[Assignment attribute](/app/experiment-configuration#experiment-targeting-and-traffic): Assignment attribute in GrowthBook is a user-specific attribute (like user id, device id, etc.) used to consistently assign the same user to the same variation across multiple sessions or devices.

**B**

[Binomial Metric](/app/metrics#binomial-metrics): A binomial metric in GrowthBook is a type of metric that represents a binary outcome (yes/no or success/failure), such as whether a user converted or not, and is used to compute the proportion of users in an experiment variation who converted.

**C**

[Carryover Bias](/kb/experiments/carryover-bias): Carryover bias in GrowthBook refers to the contamination of experiment results when users are not re-randomized between different phases of an experiment, causing the effects of the first phase to influence the results of the subsequent phase.
