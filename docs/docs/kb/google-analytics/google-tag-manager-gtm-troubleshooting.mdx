# GrowthBook and Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is commonly configured by GrowthBook users to work alongside their Google Analytics (GA4) instance. This article helps troubleshoot common issues encountered when integrating GTM directly with GrowthBook, and when integrating GTM indirectly with GrowthBook through its connection to GA4.

## Common issues when integrating GTM with GrowthBook

The issues described below are commonly reported and can lead to missing or incomplete experiment data in GA4 when using GTM with GrowthBook.

### GTM variables, triggers, or tags are not properly configured
Users often miss creating the necessary dataLayer variables for `experiment_id` and `variation_id`, or do not set up the Custom Event Trigger for `experiment_viewed` correctly. If the GA4 Event Tag is not configured to use these variables, the event will not be sent to GA4 from GTM.

### Missing or incorrect `dataLayer` push
If the GrowthBook SDK’s `trackingCallback` does not push the `experiment_viewed` event to the dataLayer, or if the event structure is incorrect, GTM will not detect or forward the event to GA4. The event must be pushed in the correct format, such as:
  ```js
  // JavaScript
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  window.dataLayer.push({
    event: "experiment_viewed",
    experiment_id: experiment.key,
    variation_id: result.key,
  });
  ```

See the [Tracking via dataLayer and GTM](https://docs.growthbook.io/guide/google-tag-manager-and-growthbook#4-tracking-via-datalayer-and-gtm) documentation for more information.

### Missing hash attribute

The [hash attribute](https://docs.growthbook.io/faq#do-users-always-get-assigned-the-same-experiment-variation) is a unique identifier for a user, such as a `user_id` or a `device_id`. It's a crucial part of the GrowthBook SDK because it is used to determine which users are included in an experiment. If the hash attribute is missing, it can prevent the `trackingCallback` from firing.

Ensure that the hash attribute is correctly set when initializing the GrowthBook instance. The [GrowthBook DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia) can help debug issues with the hash attribute.

### Sequencing and timing issues
GrowthBook's [DevTools Browser Extension](https://docs.growthbook.io/tools/chrome-extension) (available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/growthbook-devtools/)) is especially helpful for troubleshooting timing and sequencing issues common with GTM setups because it lets you confirm whether GrowthBook is running and receiving the correct data on your site.

#### GTM not loaded before GrowthBook's `trackingCallback` is sent
If GrowthBook fires the `experiment_viewed` event via the `trackingCallback` before GTM is fully loaded, the event may be missed. This can happen if scripts are loaded in the wrong order or if there are delays in page load.

#### Loading GrowthBook via GTM (not recommended)
Loading GrowthBook via GTM can introduce delays, and if GTM is slow to load, the event may be pushed to the dataLayer before GTM is ready to listen for it.

#### Avoiding sequencing and timing issues
Ensure that the GrowthBook SDK is loaded and initialized only after GTM has finished loading. One recommended approach is to add the GrowthBook script directly to the page’s `<head>` instead of injecting it via GTM, as this can help with performance and sequencing issues.

#### Troubleshoot using GTM's preview mode
Additionally, you can use GTM’s preview mode to verify the order in which tags are firing and adjust your triggers or tag sequencing to ensure GTM is ready before GrowthBook’s `trackingCallback` executes. This helps ensure that the `experiment_viewed` event is captured reliably by GTM and forwarded to GA4.

### Consent and cookie banner blocking
If a cookie consent banner blocks analytics until consent is given, the `experiment_viewed` event may be sent before consent, causing it to be dropped or not sent at all.

Delay initializing the GrowthBook SDK and firing the `trackingCallback` (which will send the `experiment_viewed` event) until after the user has granted consent. This ensures that analytics and experiment exposure events are only sent when it is legally and technically permitted. 

#### Special instructions if using the HTML Script Tag SDK or the Edge SDK
If you are using GrowthBook’s script tag or Edge SDK, you can also use the `data-no-auto-cookies` attribute or the `NO_AUTO_COOKIES="true"` environment variable to prevent the SDK from setting cookies or persisting user assignments until consent is granted.

### Persist the cookie after consent
Once consent is given, you can manually persist the cookie by dispatching the following event:

```js
// JavaScript
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("growthbookpersist"));
```

Read more about cookies and GDPR compliance in the docs for the [HTML Script Tag SDK](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/script-tag#cookie-policy-and-gdpr) and [Edge SDK](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/edge/lambda#cookie-policy-and-gdpr).

### Ad Blockers or Privacy Extensions
Some users may have ad blockers or privacy browser extensions that block analytics scripts or dataLayer pushes, ultimately leading to missing events in GA4. In these cases, the GTM container may not load at all, no tags fire, and/or GA4 events may never be sent, even if GTM loads. Thus conversion tracking, user behavior data, and pageviews are underreported

#### Troubleshoot using GTM's preview mode
You can use GTM’s preview mode to verify that the `experiment_viewed` event appears in the dataLayer and that the GA4 Event Tag is firing as expected. View our [GTM testing documentation](https://docs.growthbook.io/guide/google-tag-manager-and-growthbook#testing-your-setup) for more info.

## Why are there no `experiment_viewed` events showing in GTM?
The `experiment_viewed` events should show in Google Tag Manager (GTM) if the GrowthBook implementation is set up to push these events to the dataLayer. This is a standard approach when integrating GrowthBook experiments with GTM and Google Analytics 4 (GA4).

When a user is exposed to an experiment, GrowthBook (via a `trackingCallback` or the HTML SDK) will push an event like this to the dataLayer:

```js
{
  event: "experiment_viewed",
  experiment_id: "...",
  variation_id: "..."
}
```

GTM will listen for this event and forward it to GA4 or other analytics tools.

### If you do not see `experiment_viewed` events in GTM
- Ensure the `trackingCallback` is correctly implemented
- Ensure the required dataLayer variables and triggers in GTM have been configured properly by reviewing [Using GrowthBook with Google Tag Manager (GTM)](https://docs.growthbook.io/guide/google-tag-manager-and-growthbook#4-tracking-via-datalayer-and-gtm).

If you are using the HTML Script SDK, the `experiment_viewed` event is pushed to the dataLayer automatically. For other SDKs, the `trackingCallback` needs to be implemented manually to ensure the `experiment_viewed` event is pushed to the dataLayer.

## Why is GTM not passing my `experiment_viewed` events along to GA4?

Many of the troubleshooting strategies outlined above will also help debug situations where GTM is not passing `experiment_viewed` events to GA4.

### The dataLayer event is not configured or triggered properly**  
If the experiment_viewed event is not being pushed to the dataLayer in the expected format, GTM will not detect it. For example, if the event is pushed as an array instead of an object, the GTM trigger may not fire as documented. You should ensure the event is pushed in the format shown below. If the format is incorrect, the trigger will not activate.

```js

// JavaScript
window.dataLayer.push({
  event: "experiment_viewed",
  experiment_id: "...",
  variation_id: "..."
});
```

### Missing or Incorrect GTM Variables and Triggers
GTM requires you to set up Data Layer Variables for `experiment_id` and `variation_id` and a Custom Event Trigger for `experiment_viewed`. If these are not set up or are misconfigured, the event will not be passed to GA4.

### GTM Tag Not Firing  
If the GA4 Event Tag in GTM is not set to fire on the `experiment_viewed` event, or if the trigger conditions are not met, the event will not be sent to GA4. Double-check the trigger configuration and ensure it matches the event name and parameters.

### Timing Issues
Sometimes, the event may be pushed to the dataLayer before GTM is fully loaded, or before the relevant tags and triggers are ready. This can result in GTM missing the event.

### GTM Security Restrictions
If you are injecting the GrowthBook script via GTM (not recommended), GTM may strip out data attributes (like `data-client-key`), causing the SDK to not initialize properly and thus not push events to the dataLayer.

### GA4 Tag Configuration Issues 
Even if the event is in the dataLayer and the trigger fires, if the GA4 Event Tag is not configured with the correct parameters (`experiment_id`, `variation_id`), the data may not be sent or may be sent incorrectly.

### Data Propagation Delay 
Sometimes, there is a delay between when the event is sent and when it appears in GA4. This is normal, but if you never see the event, it’s likely a configuration issue [Hello!

## Use GrowthBook's Chrome Developer Tools extension to debug GTM issues

Use the [GrowthBook DevTools Browser Extension](https://docs.growthbook.io/tools/chrome-extension) (available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/growthbook-devtools/)) to debug issues with GTM by:

- Inspecting whether the GrowthBook SDK is properly loaded
- Checking which feature flags and experiments are active
- Verifying if user attributes are set as expected

The extension allows you to see real-time information about feature flags and experiments directly in your browser, making it easier to identify if the SDK is initialized correctly and if experiments are being evaluated as intended.

To use the DevTools extension for debugging:

1. **Enable Dev Mode:** Make sure your GrowthBook SDK is initialized with `enableDevMode: true`. This is required for the extension to connect and display information about your feature flags and experiments ([Dev Mode Docs](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/js#dev-mode), [DevTools Docs](https://docs.growthbook.io/tools/chrome-extension)).

2. **Open the Extension:**  
   - Use the popup from your browser toolbar for a quick overview.
   - Or, open your browser’s Developer Tools and select the **GrowthBook** tab for a more detailed view.

3. **Debugging with GTM:**  
   - Check if the SDK is detected (look for a green dot on the extension icon).
   - Inspect which experiments and feature flags are active and their current values.
   - Verify that user attributes (such as IDs used for bucketing) are set correctly.
   - If you’re not seeing expected experiments or flags, this may indicate issues with the GTM tag firing order, SDK initialization, or attribute configuration.

If the extension cannot detect the SDK, double-check that your GTM tags are firing in the correct order and that `enableDevMode` is enabled. This can help you quickly pinpoint where the integration might be failing.
