# API

GrowthBook offers a full REST API for interacting with the application.

[View REST API Docs](/api/)

## SDK Connection Endpoints

In addition to the REST API above, there is one additional readonly endpoint - the SDK Connection Endpoint.

The SDK Connection Endpoint provides readonly access to a subset of your feature flag data, just enough for the [GrowthBook SDKs](/lib) to assign values to users. They are meant to be public and do not require authentication to view.

In **GrowthBook Cloud**, the SDK Connection Endpoints are served from our global CDN: `https://cdn.growthbook.io/api/features/...`. If you are self-hosting, you can use [your own CDN](/self-host/cdn) or run the [GrowthBook Proxy server](/self-host/proxy), which provides built-in caching and performance optimizations.

SDK Connection Endpoints are scoped to a single Environment (e.g. `dev` or `production`) and can also be scoped to a single Project. Manage all of your SDK Connections on the **Features → SDKs** page.

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  features: {
    [key: string]: FeatureDefinition
  }
}

interface FeatureDefinition {
  defaultValue: any;
  rules?: FeatureDefinitionRule[];
}

interface FeatureDefinitionRule {
  force?: any;
  weights?: number[];
  variations?: any[];
  hashAttribute?: string;
  hashVersion?: number;
  seed?: string;
  namespace?: [string, number, number];
  key?: string;
  coverage?: number;
  condition?: any;
  meta?: VariationMeta[];
  name?: string;
  phase?: string;
}

interface VariationMeta = {
  passthrough?: boolean;
  key?: string;
  name?: string;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "features": {
    "feature-key": {
      "defaultValue": true
    },
    "another-feature": {
      "defaultValue": "blue",
      "rules": [
        {
          "condition": {
            "browser": "firefox"
          },
          "force": "green"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Encryption

If you've enabled encryption for your SDK endpoint, the response format changes:

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Typescript Type Definition</summary>

```ts
interface SDKEncryptedEndpointResponse {
  status: 200;
  encryptedFeatures: string;
}
```

</details>

<details className="mb-3">
<summary className="cursor-pointer">Example JSON object</summary>

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "encryptedFeatures": "abcdef123456GHIJKL0987654321..."
}
```

</details>

You will need to decrypt the features first before passing into the SDK. Our front-end SDKs (Javascript and React) handle this for you automatically and we're in the process of adding built-in support to our other SDKs.
