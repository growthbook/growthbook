# Metrics and Fact Tables

Metrics are how you measure success and failure for your business. An e-commerce company might have metrics related to conversion rates, revenue, and cart abandonment. A B2B SaaS company might have metrics around subscription trials, cancellations, and usage. Every company is different and GrowthBook is flexible enough to support a wide variety of use cases.

The primary way to create metrics in GrowthBook is with **Fact Tables** where you write SQL to pull a set of rows and then define multiple metrics on top of those rows. There is also a [legacy method](/app/metrics/legacy) where each metric has its own self-contained SQL. Fact Tables are easier to use, faster to query, and more powerful, so we highly recommend using them for all new metrics.

If you learn best by example, you can jump straight into [Metric Examples and Use Cases](/app/metrics/examples).

## Fact Tables

Fact Tables are defined by a SQL SELECT statement and are the base that metrics are built on top of.

At a minimum, a Fact Table must select the following columns:

- `timestamp` - The date the event happened
- One column per supported identifier type (e.g. `user_id` and `anonymous_id`). The possible identifier types depend on your data source settings.

Any other columns you return can be used to create metrics or used as a filter.

Here's a full example:

```sql
SELECT
  -- Required columns
  purchase_date as timestamp,
  user_id,
  anonymous_id,
  -- Additional columns (depends on your use case)
  amount,
  coupon_code,
  device_type
FROM
  orders
WHERE
  status = 'completed'
```

This is an example of a "modeled table", which represents a specific order event and has dedicated columns related to orders. GrowthBook also works great with raw event stream tables and even some pre-aggregated tables. Check out [Metric Examples and Use Cases](/app/metrics/examples) for more info and examples of these different data schemas and table types.

### Columns

When you create a Fact Table, we query the first few rows and inspect the returned data to determine which columns you've selected and what data types they are.

This process isn't perfect. For example, if the first few rows happen to have `null` as the value of a column, we can't tell if it's supposed to be a number, string, etc.. When this happens, we will show you a warning and you can manually specify the type.

Any column can be used to create filters, but only numeric columns can be used as a metric value.

#### Number Formats

For numeric columns, you can also specify a number format, which controls how the metric is displayed on the front-end. Possible values are `currency` and `time:seconds`.

:::note
The default display currency is USD, but you can change it under **Settings** → **General** → **Metric Settings**
:::

## Metric Types

There are 4 types of metrics you can create within GrowthBook - Proportion, Mean, Quantile, and Ratio.

### Proportion Metrics

Proportion Metrics measure the percent of users in an experiment who exist in a Fact Table (and match any filters you specify).

For example, if you have an Orders Fact Table, you can create a Proportion Metric to see what percent of users purchased something. For this metric, we don't care how many times they purchased, just that they have at least 1 matching row.

### Mean Metrics

Mean Metrics are useful when there are more than 2 possible states a user can be in. For example, instead of just purchase/not purchase, you might care about the average number of orders a user makes, or the average revenue you earned per user in an experiment.

For the metric value, there are 2 types of aggregations you can do - `COUNT(*)` and `SUM(column)`. For `SUM`, you will be able to choose any numeric column in your Fact Table.

For example, an **Orders per User** metric would use `COUNT(*)` since you want to count the total number of rows. A **Revenue per User** metric would use `SUM` and select the column where the order total is stored.

The denominator for Mean Metrics is always the number of users in an experiment variation. So, even though you may be doing `SUM(revenue)` as the aggregation, it will be divided by number of users and you will actually end up with an average value per user, not an overall sum for the variation.

### Ratio Metrics

Ratio Metrics let you pick a custom denominator and allow for metrics such as **Average Order Value** (denominator is number of orders) or **Session Duration** (denominator is number of sessions).

For both the numerator and denominator, you can select a Fact Table, an aggregation, and optional filters. GrowthBook allows the numerator and denominator to have different Fact Tables, which can open up some really advanced use cases.

The types of aggregations supported for ratio metrics are:

- `COUNT(*)` - Number of rows in the Fact Table
- `COUNT(DISTINCT 'User Identifier')` - Sample size of the experiment variation
- `SUM(column)` - Total of a numeric column in the Fact Table

Under the hood, GrowthBook uses the Delta Method to accurately determine the variance.

For example, to create a **Session Duration** metric, you would do the following:

- Numerator: `SUM(duration)` from a `Sessions` fact table
- Denominator: `COUNT(*)` from a `Sessions` fact table

### Quantile Metrics

Quantile Metrics are useful when you care about comparing variations at a quantile (e.g. latency at P99) rather than the mean. Learn more about when to use Quantile Metrics [here](/statistics/quantile).

One key consideration is `Group by Experiment User before taking quantile?`. In short, if you often think about your metric at the user level, you should aggregate. If you think about your metric at the event level, do not aggregate.

For the metric value, the only aggregation available is `SUM(column)`. For `SUM`, you will be able to choose any numeric column in your Fact Table.

You have the option to `Ignore Zeros`.
For event-level analysis, ignoring zeros entails removing all events from the analysis with value equal to 0. Similarly, for a user-level analysis, removing zeros entails removing all rows corresponding to user-level aggregations that have value 0.

When picking `Quantile` you have several default options or can select `Custom`. If you select `Custom` you must input a number between 0 and 1. For example, inputting 0.75 will compare the $75^{\text{th}}$ percentiles across variations.

## Filters

The real power of Fact Tables comes with filtering. This allows you to easily create metric variants.

There are 3 kinds of filtering available

- Inline Filters
- Row Filters
- User Filters

### Inline Filters

It's common to have an important "type" column that you use to build out metrics. For example, if your Fact Table is a raw event stream, there will be a column like `event_type` to differentiate between a page view, button click, purchase, etc.. You will almost always want to filter metrics using this column.

After creating your Fact Table, you can edit a column and check the “Prompt all metrics” box. This helps GrowthBook better streamline the UI when creating metrics.

![Marking an Event Type column](/images/metrics/inline-filter.png)

When you check this box, GrowthBook will run a quick query looking for the top 100 values for this column in the past week. This will be used to add an auto-complete field in the UI when creating a metric:

![Event Type Filter UI](/images/metrics/event-type-filter-metric-form.png)

Another example use of this checkbox is for a `Page Path` column in a `Page Views` Fact Table. This will streamline creation of metrics such as "Visited /checkout", "Visited /pricing", and more.

If you select multiple values for an inline filter, they will be ORed together.

### Row Filters

Row Filters are reusable SQL snippets defined within a Fact Table. Once defined, they can be applied to any metric type.

Here's an example Row Filter SQL:

```sql
device_type = 'mobile'
```

If a metric uses this Filter, GrowthBook will add it to the WHERE clause automatically. If there are multiple Filters, they will be ANDed together.

### User Filters

User Filters are different from both Inline and Row Filters in that they are applied AFTER aggregating by user.

You can either filter on the `Count of Rows` or the `SUM` of a numeric column. This can be easier to understand with examples:

- Count of rows: `>= 3`: Only include users with at least 3 rows in a Fact Table
- SUM of a revenue column: `> 100`: Only include users who have spent at least $100 total across all of their orders.

Only simple SQL comparison operators are supported: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `<>`. User Filters can only be applied to Proportion metrics and the numerator of Ratio metrics (only when using `COUNT(DISTINCT 'User Identifier')`).

## Metric Windows

When used in an experiment, we only consider rows of a Metric where the timestamp is greater than or equal to the first time the user was exposed to the experiment. In other words, if someone purchases something before seeing your experiment, it won't be included in the analysis. This behavior is ideal for the vast majority of metrics, but you can change it with the Metric Delay setting if desired (see below).

There are three window settings one can use to configure the metric date window. Each of them defines the lower and upper date range of the metric to use for each user:

- **None** (default)
  - Lower bound: user's first exposure plus the metric delay
  - Upper bound: experiment end date
- **Conversion Window**
  - Lower bound: user's first exposure plus the metric delay
  - Upper bound: the lower bound + the length of the conversion window
- **Lookback Window**
  - Lower bound: the experiment end date minus the lookback window OR the user's first exposure plus the metric delay, whichever is later
  - Upper bound: experiment end date

Here's a graphical representation of these three window types for a hypothetical User 1:
![Metric Windows](/images/metric-windows.png)

Here's a second example for a hypothetical User 2, who joins the experiment late. Notice that the conversion window can extend beyond the experiment end date.
![Metric Windows (User 2)](/images/metric-windows-user-2.png)

Why might you choose one window over another?

**None** - The simplest. Use all data available. This is useful for using as much data associated with users in your experiment and will combine any behavior that is right after experiment exposure as well as long run behavior within the experiment time frame.

**Conversion window** - Conversion windows allow you to only look at events that are tied to the first exposure to an experiment. This can help if, for example, you are tracking purchases and you only want to measure the effect of an experiment in a checkout flow on purchases made soon after seeing that checkout flow. Using a conversion window can reduce the noise from user behavior not related to an experiment. However, if you set the window too short, you may not capture users that return a few days later and were influenced by the experiment.

**Lookback window** - Lookback windows are good for capturing long run impacts of an experiment on regular behavior like user log ins or page views. They have two main advantages:

(1) You can mitigate the novelty effect of an experiment; if you are testing a new recommendation algorithm, at first users may react a certain way to the experiment, but eventually they may adjust and so may their behavior. In these cases, you may just want to look at the last 14 days of an experiment.

(2) Lookback windows help you focus on the long run effects of an experiment. Much of experimentation is about building a better product; by focusing on impact of an experiment after it has been live for a week or two, you may get a better picture of the long run impact of launching the experiment.

Larger companies who measure long run logged in behavior want to ensure their experiments have lasting effects and often rely on lookback windows to make shipping decisions. However, lookback windows may not be right if you are testing a feature on logged-out or anonymous users and are measuring simple purchase conversions or something similar. In these cases, you might end up with many logged-out users who, in the long run, simply have no metric data associated with them.

## Advanced Settings

### What is the Goal?

For the vast majority of metrics, the goal is to increase the value. But for some metrics like "Bounce Rate" and "Page Load Time", lower is actually better.

Setting this to "decrease" basically inverts the "Chance to Beat Control" value in experiment results so that "beating" the control means decreasing the value. This will also reverse the red and green coloring on graphs.

### Capped Value

Large outliers can have an outsized effect on experiment results. For example, if your normal revenue per user \$40 and someone happens to make a \$5000 order, whatever variation that person is in will be much more likely "win" any experiment because that one order is an outlier.

Capping (also known as winsorization) works by ensuring that all aggregate unit (e.g. user) values are no more than some value. So in the above example, if the cap was \$100, the \$5000 purchase will still be counted, but the aggregated value for that user will be capped at \$100 and will have a much smaller effect on the results. It will still give a boost to whatever variation the person is in, but it won't completely dominate all of the other orders and is unlikely to make a winner just on its own. Another way to think about this is that you are slightly biasing your results by truncating large values, but you are reducing variance to prevent the outsized effect of outliers.

There are two ways to cap metric values in GrowthBook:

**1. Absolute capping** - if set above zero, all aggregated user values will be capped at exactly this value. For example, if the cap is \$100 on total revenue per user, then after we sum all of a users orders up, any user with an aggregate sum of greater than \$100 will be set to \$100.

**2. Percentile capping** - when this is set to between 0 and 1, it uses that percentile to select a cap based on the data in your experiment so far. This cap is therefore specific to each experiment and specific to each analysis run in that experiment if new data has come in. It works like so: after we calculate the unit-level aggregate values for all units (e.g. users) during an experiment analysis, we find the specified percentile of these unit-level aggregates and then cap these aggregated values at this percentile. Using the above example, if you were to specify percentile capping with a value of `0.95`, then we find the 95th percentile of total revenue per users (say this turns out to be \$135). We then cap those user-level aggregates at \$135.

You can additionally choose to ignore zeros, which will compute the percentile without including any user aggregated zero values. This is useful if you have a lot of zero values and you don't want to have to fine tune the percentile to avoid setting the cap too low.

Because the percentile cap depends on the data in your experiment, it can be different from experiment to experiment, or even analysis to analysis. To find out what value was actually used for capping you can do the following: on the Experiment Results tab, click the three dot menu in the top right and select "View Queries". Each percentile capped metric will have a column with the `main_cap_value` that was used to cap that metric and represents the computed percentile of unit-level aggregate values.

### Metric Delay

Conversions within the first X hours of being put into an experiment are ignored (default = `0`). This is useful for metrics like "day 2 retention". In that case, if your underlying table reports whether a user is retained on any given day, you could set a metric delay to `24` hours.

#### Negative metric delays

The metric delay can also be negative to include some conversions **before** a user is put into an experiment. For example, a value of `-2` would mean conversions up to 2 hours before will be included. You might be wondering when this would ever be useful.

Imagine the average person stays on your site for 60 seconds and your experiment can trigger at any time.

If you just look at the average time spent after the experiment, the numbers will lose a lot of meaning. A value of `20 seconds` might be horrible if it happened to someone after only 5 seconds on your site since they are staying a lot less time than average. But, that same `20 seconds` might be great if it happened to someone after 55 seconds since their visit is a lot longer than usual.
Over time, these things will average out and you can eventually see patterns, but you need an enormous amount of data to get to that point.

If you set the metric delay to something negative, say `-0.5` (30 minutes), you can reduce the amount of data you need to see patterns. For example, you may see your average go from 60 seconds to 65 seconds.

Keep in mind, these two things are answering slightly different questions.
`How much longer do people stay after viewing the experiment?` vs `How much longer is an average session that includes the experiment?`.
The first question is more direct and often a more strict test of your hypothesis, but it may not be worth the extra running time.

### Bayesian Priors

Your organization can set default priors for Bayesian analyses that are used by all metrics.

However, you can also set metric specific priors by opening the Edit Metric modal from the Metric page, clicking on Advanced Settings, and turning on the metric override. This will allow you to set a custom prior for that metric.

Additionally, you can use experiment metric overrides to further customize these priors for each experiment.

You can read more about Bayesian priors on [our statistical details page](/statistics/details).

## Metric Analysis

After creating a metric, you can perform some basic analysis on it. Depending on the metric type, we show you the average value over time, a histogram breakdown, and more. You can customize the date range and population that's included.

We have a lot more we want to do here in the future, so let us know what other kinds of analyses you are most excited about!

## Metric Groups

There are often groups of metrics you want to add together to an experiment. For example, 5 key revenue metrics that you add to anything touching the checkout flow.

GrowthBook Enterprise customers can define Metric Groups to accomplish this. Add multiple metrics, drag & drop to order them, and add them in bulk to experiments as Goals, Guardrails, or Secondary Metrics.

## Database Cost Optimization

For large Fact Tables, it can be important to consider query costs, especially when using a data warehouse like BigQuery which charges based on data scanned.

### Date Partitioning

The most effective way to limit database cost is to partition your tables by date. Without this, we have to scan the entire table every time instead of just focusing on the date range we care about.

We add WHERE clauses on the `timestamp` column for every query, but sometimes the database engine is not smart enough to pick up on these (or you might use a secondary column for partitioning). For these cases, we allow you to add Template Variables (using Handlebars syntax) to add your own filtering.

The following variables are available:

- **startDate** - `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` of the earliest data that needs to be included
- **startDateISO** - `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'` of the startDate in ISO format
- **endDate** - `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` of the latest data that needs to be included
- **endDateISO** - `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'` of the endDate in ISO format

There is also a `date` helper you can use with the ISO variables to format the date exactly how you need it. For example `{{date endDateISO "yyyyMMdd"}}`

| code | meaning   |
| ---- | --------- |
| yyyy | year      |
| MM   | month     |
| dd   | day       |
| HH   | hour      |
| mm   | minutes   |
| ss   | seconds   |
| t    | timestamp |

Here's a full example of this being used:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id as user_id,
  received_at as timestamp
FROM
  orders
WHERE
  partition_key BETWEEN
    '{{date startDateISO "yyyyMMdd"}}' AND '{{date endDateISO "yyyyMMdd"}}'
```

:::note

The inserted values do not have surrounding quotes, so you must add those yourself (e.g. use `'{{ startDate }}'` instead of `{{ startDate }}`).

:::

### Fact Table Query Optimization

GrowthBook Enterprise customers can enable Fact Table Query Optimization for faster, more efficient queries.

If multiple metrics from the same Fact Table are added to an experiment, they will be combined into a single SQL query. For data sourcees with usage-based billing, this can result in dramatic cost savings.

There are some restrictions that limit when this optimization can be performed:

- Ratio metrics where the numerator and denominator are part of different Fact Tables are always excluded from this optimization
- If `Exclude In-Progress Conversions` is set for an experiment, optimization is disabled for all metrics
- If you are using MySQL and a metric has percentile capping, it will be excluded from optimization

In all other cases, this optimization is enabled by default for all Enterprise customers. It can be disabled under **Settings → General → Experiment Settings**. When disabled, a separate SQL query will always be run for every individual metric.
