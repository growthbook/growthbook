# Sticky Bucketing

This article serves two purposes:

- High level overview of GrowthBook's Sticky Bucketing feature
- Technical details on how to implement Sticky Bucketing in your codebase

Sticky bucketing ensures that users see the same experiment variant, even when user session, user login status, or experiment parameters change.
GrowthBook's flavor of sticky bucketing has a few additional features: Bucketing based either a primary hash attribute (i.e. user id) or a secondary (i.e. anonymous id),
as well as the ability to version-control and purge your users' assigned buckets.

So why would you want to use Sticky Bucketing? Let's look at a few example scenarios:

1. You are measuring the impact on a metric with a long conversion window that crosses the log-in divide. The user may be first exposed to your experiment while anonymous,
   then sign up, log out, sign back in on another device, and then convert. Without sticky bucketing, there would be no way to tie the anonymous exposure to the conversion.
2. You are managing an experiment rollout and need to slow down enrollment. You decrease the percentage of traffic exposed to the experiment from 50% to 10% but you do not want to
   alter the experience for users who were already exposed to the experiment. Sticky bucketing allows you to apply the new rollout percentage to new users while keeping the old users
   in their original buckets.
