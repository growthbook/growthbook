Unleash the power of experimentation with GrowthBook to supercharge your Webflow site—no coding skills required!

## Let's Get Started

### Step 1: Create a GrowthBook SDK Connection

To connect your GrowthBook account to Webflow, you'll need to create a new SDK Connection and select the `Webflow` option. Before saving, confirm that you've enabled the toggles for `Include visual experiments in endpoint's response?` and `Include draft experiments`.

### Step 2: Add GrowthBook to Your Webflow Site

Once the SDK Connection is created, you should see a code snippet that you need to add to your site.

In a new window, log into your Webflow account, navigate to your site's settings, and select the `Custom Code` tab.

Find the "Head Code" section, and paste in the code snippet from GrowthBook. It should look something like this:

:::info Tracking experiment views

When a user views an experiment, the code above will fire an event that tracks which variation the user saw. If you have Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Segment installed on your site, you don't have to do any additional configuration. If, however, you need to use a different analytics provider, you can follow our guide [here](/lib/script-tag).

Once added, save and publish the changes and navigate back to GrowthBook.

### Step 3: Install the GrowthBook DevTools Browser Extension

The GrowthBook DevTools browser extension enables you to use the Visual Editor to update your Shopify website content. Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia) (Chrome) or from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/growthbook-devtools/) (Firefox).

Next, open the DevTools extension by clicking the extension icon.

- Find and click on the cog icon ⚙️.
- Enter your Personal Access Token (available in GrowthBook from the **main dropdown menu** → **Personal Access Tokens**).
- Click "Save". The GrowthBook browser extension is all set up!

### Step 4: Create a GrowthBook Visual Editor Experiment

Now that GrowthBook is installed on your Webflow site, you can create a new experiment using the Visual Editor.

First, navigate to "Experiments" on the left-hand navigation menu and then click "Create Experiment", before selecting "Design a New Experiment" and following the on-screen prompts.

Once you've created your experiment, select "Visual Editor" as the editor type and enter the URL of your Webflow site.
