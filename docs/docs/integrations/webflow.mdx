## Let's Get Started

### Step 1: Create a GrowthBook SDK Connection

To connect your GrowthBook account to Webflow, you'll need to create a new SDK Connection and select the `Webflow` option. Before saving, confirm that you've enabled the toggles for `Include visual experiments in endpoint's response?` and `Include draft experiments`.

### Step 2: Add GrowthBook to Your Webflow Site

Once the SDK Connection is created, you should see a code snippet that you need to add to your site.

In a new window, log into your Webflow account, navigate to your site's settings, and select the `Custom Code` tab.

Find the "Head Code" section, and paste in the code snippet from GrowthBook. It should look something like this:

When a user views an experiment, the code above will fire an event that tracks which variation the user saw. If you have Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Segment installed on your site, you don't have to do any additional configuration. If, however, you need to use a different analytics provider, you can follow our guide [here](/lib/script-tag).

Once added, save and publish the changes and navigate back to GrowthBook.

### Step 3: Install the GrowthBook Chrome Extension

The GrowthBook Chrome Extension allows you to use the Visual Editor to update your Webflow site's content. It's free, and you can download it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia).

### Step 4: Create a GrowthBook Visual Editor Experiment

Now that GrowthBook is installed on your Webflow site, you can create a new experiment using the Visual Editor.

First, navigate to "Experiments" on the left-hand navigation menu and then click "Create Experiment", before selecting "Design a New Experiment" and following the on-screen prompts.

Once you've created your experiment, select "Visual Editor" as the editor type and enter the URL of your Webflow site.

You'll then be redirected to your site, where you can use the Visual Editor to update your site's content.
