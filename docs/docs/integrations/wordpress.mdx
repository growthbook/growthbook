# Wordpress Integration

Unleash the power of experimentation with GrowthBook to supercharge your Wordpress site—no coding skills required!

This guide walks you through creating experiments using the GrowthBook Visual Editor, which requires a `Pro` subscription. [Learn More](https://www.growthbook.io/pricing).

## Let's Get Started

### Step 1: Create a GrowthBook SDK Connection

To connect your GrowthBook account to Wordpress, you'll need to create a new SDK Connection and select the `Wordpress` option. Before saving, confirm that you've enabled the toggles for `Include visual experiments in endpoint's response?` and `Include draft experiments`.

### Step 2: Add GrowthBook to Your Wordpress Site

Once the SDK Connection is created, you should see a code snippet that you need to add to your site.

The easiest way to do this is with the popular [Insert Headers and Footers Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/.insert-headers-and-footers/) by WPCode. Install and activate this plugin if you don't have it already.

On the left-hand side of your dashboard, navigate to Code Snippets → Header & Footer.

Insert the SDK Connection code snippet into your site's Head:

Here's an example of how it should look:

```html
<script async
  data-client-key="YOUR_CLIENT_KEY"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@growthbook/growthbook/dist/bundles/auto.min.js"
></script>
```

:::info Note

When a user views an experiment, this script will fire an event that tracks which variation the user saw. If you have Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Segment installed on your site, you don't have to do any additional configuration. If, however, you need to use a different analytics provider, you can follow our guide [here](/lib/script-tag).

Once added, navigate back to GrowthBook.

### Step 3: Install the GrowthBook Chrome Extension

The GrowthBook Chrome Extension allows you to use the Visual Editor to update your Wordpress site's content. It's free, and you can download it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia).

### Step 4: Create a GrowthBook Visual Editor Experiment

:::info Note

If you have questions about how to use the Visual Editor, [check out our guide here](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/visual).

:::

Now that GrowthBook is installed on your Wordpress site and you've installed the Chrome Extension, you can create a new experiment using the Visual Editor.

First, navigate to "Experiments" on the left-hand navigation menu and then click "Create Experiment", before selecting "Design a New Experiment" and following the on-screen prompts.

Once you've created your experiment, Add a Visual Editor change and enter the URL of your Wordpress site.

You'll then be redirected to your site, where you can use the Visual Editor to make changes.
