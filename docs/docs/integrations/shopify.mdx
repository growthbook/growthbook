## Let's Get Started

### Step 1: Create a GrowthBook SDK Connection

To connect your GrowthBook account to Shopify, you'll need to create a new SDK Connection and select `Javascript` as the language. Before saving, confirm that you've enabled the toggles for `Include visual experiments in endpoint's response?` and `Include draft experiments`.

### Step 2: Add GrowthBook to Your Shopify Theme

Once the SDK Connection is created, you'll want to locate the `Client Key` from the <strong>Implementation Instructions</strong> section.

Then, log into your Shopify account, navigate to your online store, and edit your store's code.

Once you're in the code editor, locate the `theme.liquid` file and add the following snippet to the file just before the closing `</head>` tag. Be sure to replace the `data-client-key` with the `Client Key` you located above.

```js
    <script async
      data-client-key="ADD_YOUR_CLIENT_KEY_HERE"
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@growthbook/growthbook/dist/bundles/auto.min.js"
    ></script>
```

When a user views an experiment, the code above will fire an event that tracks which variation the user saw. If you have Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Segment installed on your store, you don't have to do any additional configuration. If, however, you need to use a different analytics provider, you can follow our guide [here](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/visual#option-2-pre-built-script-tag-best-for-shopify-webflow).

Once added, click "Save" and navigate back to GrowthBook.

### Step 3: Install the GrowthBook Chrome Extension

The GrowthBook Chrome Extension allows you to use the Visual Editor to update your Shopify store's content. It's free, and you can download it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia).

### Step 4: Create a GrowthBook Visual Editor Experiment

Now that GrowthBook is installed on your Shopify store and you've installed the Chrome Extension, you can create a new experiment using the Visual Editor.

First, navigate to "Experiments" on the left-hand navigation menu and then click "Create Experiment", before selecting "Design a New Experiment" and following the on-screen prompts.

Once you've created your experiment, select "Visual Editor" as the editor type and enter the URL of your Shopify store.
