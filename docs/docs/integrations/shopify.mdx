Unleash the power of experimentation with GrowthBook to supercharge your Shopify store—no coding skills required!

## Let's Get Started

### Step 1: Create a GrowthBook SDK Connection

To connect your GrowthBook account to Shopify, you'll need to create a new SDK Connection and select the `Shopify` option. Before saving, confirm that you've enabled the toggles for `Include visual experiments in endpoint's response?` and `Include draft experiments`.

### Step 2: Add GrowthBook to Your Shopify Theme

Once the SDK Connection is created, you should see a code snippet that you need to add to your store.

Log into your Shopify account, navigate to your online store, and edit your store's code.

Once you're in the code editor, locate the `theme.liquid` file and add the snippet exactly as shown just before the closing `</head>` tag. Here's an example of how it should look:

When a user views an experiment, this script will fire an event that tracks which variation the user saw. If you have Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or Segment installed on your store, you don't have to do any additional configuration. If, however, you need to use a different analytics provider, you can follow our guide [here](/lib/script-tag).

Once added, click "Save" and navigate back to GrowthBook.

### Step 3: Install the GrowthBook Chrome Extension

The GrowthBook Chrome Extension allows you to use the Visual Editor to update your Shopify store's content. It's free, and you can download it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia).

Once you have added the GrowthBook Chrome Extension to Chrome, add the API Host and API Secret to allow the Extension to communicate with your account.

To create the API Secret:
1. Login to your Growthbook account and go to [Settings > API Keys](https://app.growthbook.io/settings/keys)
2. Click "Create New Secret Key"

To add the API secret to the Growthbook Chrome Extension:
1. Once the new secret key is created, click "reveal", copy this value
2. Go to the Growthbook Chrome Extension in Chrome://extensions, and click on the Growthbook extension details
3. Click "Extension Options"
4. Paste the API secret into API secret field.
5. Copy and paste this value: `https://api.growthbook.io` into the API Host field
6. Click "submit"

### Step 4: Create a GrowthBook Visual Editor Experiment

Now that GrowthBook is installed on your Shopify store and you've installed the Chrome Extension, you can create a new experiment using the Visual Editor.

First, navigate to "Experiments" on the left-hand navigation menu and then click "Create Experiment", before selecting "Design a New Experiment" and following the on-screen prompts.

Once you've created your experiment, select "Visual Editor" as the editor type and enter the URL of your Shopify store.

You'll then be redirected to your store, where you can use the Visual Editor to update your store's content.
