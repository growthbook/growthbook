# DataDog Integration

## DataDog RUM with Feature Flag Data

Integrating DataDog's Real User Monitoring (RUM) with GrowthBook's feature flag data lets you quickly identify which experience your users were exposed to and if the changes introduced affect the user experience.

This guide will cover the initial setup and an advanced example of how to leverage DataDog and GrowthBook's powerful APIs to create a dynamic system that automatically toggles GrowthBook feature flags based on error thresholds.

### Setup

:::tip Info

If your DataDog RUM browser SDK version is below v5.17.0, [enable feature flags during RUM SDK initialization](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/guide/setup-feature-flag-data-collection/?tab=browser#setup).

:::

We can report all feature flag evaluations to DataDog using GrowthBookâ€™s SDK \`trackingCallback\` function, as shown in the snippet below.

```
trackingCallback: (experiment, result) => {
  datadogRum.addFeatureFlagEvaluation(experiment.key, result.key);
}
```

## Advanced example

...

### Add webhook (how to do it using variables?)

### Add monitor (how can we do it by skipping creating a dashboard?)

### Done
