## Creating Dashboards

To create a new dashboard, go to the experiment you want to create a dashboard for and click the **Dashboards** tab. If there are no dashboards yet, click the **Create Dashboard** button. If there are existing dashboards, the first one will be open automatically when you go to the tab. To create a new dashboard, open the select box in the top left, which lets you switch between dashboards. There will be an option there to **Create New Dashboard**.

Give the dashboard a name and select a few options:

- **Auto-update dashboard data** - If enabled, the dashboard will automatically refresh its data whenever the experiment results are updated. If disabled, the dashboard will only refresh when you manually click the update button.
- **Allow organization members to edit** - If enabled, anyone in your organization can edit this dashboard. If disabled, only you can edit it.

After creating the dashboard, you will be able to add blocks to it.

## Dashboard Blocks

An experiment dashboard consists of a set of blocks. There are several types of blocks you can add:

- **Markdown**: Add custom formatted text, images, and links to provide context and insights.
- **Experiment Metadata**: Display the description, hypothesis, and variation names/screenshots for the experiment.
- **Experiment Traffic**: Show the count of units in each experiment variation. Choose between a simple table or a timeseries chart.
- **Metric Results**: Include the main experiment results table, with the ability to customize the metrics and columns that are included.
- **Dimension Results**: Show a breakdown of a specific metric by a chosen dimension (e.g., country, device type). You can select which metric and dimension to display.
- **Time Series**: Display a timeseries chart for specific metrics within an experiment, allowing you to visualize trends over time.
- **SQL Explorer**: Show a visualization from a custom SQL query. This is useful for displaying data that isn't directly available in the standard experiment results.

## Use a Dashboard as the Default Experiment View

You can set an experiment dashboard as the default view to present a more curated, stakeholder-friendly summary of your experiment results. This is particularly useful for presenting findings from stopped experiments in a way that's easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand.

:::note
Setting a dashboard as the default view for an experiment will require experiment edit permission.
:::
**To set a dashboard as the default view:**

1. Navigate to the experiment's **Dashboards** tab
2. Select the dashboard you want to use
3. Click the **More** menu (â‹¯) and select **Set as Default View**

**To revert to the standard view:**
Follow the same steps but select **Remove as Default View** from the More menu.

When a dashboard is set as the default view, you can still access the standard experiment view by clicking **View Regular Experiment View** above the dashboard.
