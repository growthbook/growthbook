# Cluster Experiments

Cluster experiments are crucial when you need to **randomize at a group level** but **analyze at an individual level**. For example:

- A B2B software company might want to randomize at the business level so that everyone
  at the company gets the same experience, but analyze individual user behavior to measure impact.
- An education technology company might randomize at the school district level due to geographic
  constraints, but analyze outcomes at the student level.

In these cases, a cluster of units nests another set of units.

Each organization (e.g., Organization A, B, C, D) nests multiple users (e.g., User A1, A2, A3). Arrows show the hierarchical relationship between clusters (organizations) and individual users, with assignment occurring at the cluster level and analysis performed at the user level.](/images/cluster-experiments/cluster-diagram.png)

To provide a concrete example, we will use Organizations that nest Users where your goal is to randomize at the Organization level but
analyze User level behavior.

## How to run a Cluster Experiment

Running a cluster experiment at the organization level while analyzing at the user level is possible in GrowthBook using Fact Tables and the robust statistics engine. Here’s how:

### 0. Prerequisites

Before setting up your cluster experiment, ensure you have the following:

- `organization_id` must be set up as an Identifier Type on your **Data Source** page.
- If GrowthBook is handling randomization, create an Attribute `organization_id`.

### 1. Set up a Fact Table with both identifier types

You need a version of your user-level metrics that has the distinct count of users as a custom denominator.

To do this, create a [Fact Table](/app/metrics#fact-tables) that has both `organization_id` and `user_id` as columns,
along with whatever other columns you need to create your metrics of interest. You can also use multiple fact tables with this
configuration if you prefer.

:::caution

There must be a one-to-many relationship between `organization_id` and `user_id`. Avoid users belonging to multiple organizations, as this can introduce bias.

The screenshot above shows:

- `user_id` and `organization_id` identifiers.
- An `event` column that represents the event you are interested in measuring.
- A numeric `value` column that represents the value of the event.

:::info

Every `user_id` exposed to the experiment should have at least 1 event logged to ensure inclusion in the metric denominator.

:::

### 2. Set up your Metrics

Using this Fact Table, create **Ratio Metrics** that all have the `COUNT DISTINCT` of `user_id` as their denominators.

In the following example, we have a User Revenue metric:

- The numerator is sum the value of all purchases across all users.
- The denominator is the `COUNT DISTINCT` number of `user_id`.

Note that we are not filtering the denominator to just users who made a purchase—instead, our denominator includes all users that had any event in this period.

You can also create proportion-style ratio metrics:

- The numerator is a `COUNT DISTINCT` number of `user_id` that did some particular event.
- The denominator is a `COUNT DISTINCT` of `user_id` that logged any event.

These metrics are aggregated by each variation, and our statistics engine uses the [Delta Method](https://docs.growthbook.io/statistics/details#ratio-metrics) to appropriately account for the fact that you are randomizing at a different level than you are analyzing.

### 3. Create your Experiment at the Organization level

All that is left to do is create your experiment where you randomize at the `organization_id` level. The following screenshot shows an example of that.

Be sure you pick the Experiment Assignment Table that has your `organization_id` mapping. If you do not have one, you may need to set it up in your Data Source to ensure that GrowthBook knows the mapping between `organization_id` and experiment and variation assignments.

Add the metrics you created and analyze as usual!
