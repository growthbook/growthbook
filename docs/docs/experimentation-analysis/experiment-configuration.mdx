# Experiments (Setup)

The Experiments section in GrowthBook is all about analyzing raw experiment results in a data source.

Before [analyzing results](/app/experiment-results), you need to actually run the experiment. This can be done in several ways:

- [Feature Flags](/feature-flag-experiments) (most common)
- Running an inline experiment directly with our [SDKs](/lib)
- Our [Visual Editor](/app/visual) (beta)
- Your own custom variation assignment / bucketing system

When you go to add an experiment in GrowthBook, it will first look in your [data source](/warehouses) for any new experiment ids and prompt you to import them. If none are found, you can enter the experiment settings yourself.

## Adding an Experiment

You can add an experiment analysis to GrowthBook in a few ways.

**Starting an Experiment Analysis from a Feature**

This is the easiest way to start a new analysis if you have a Feature set up.
Navigate to the Feature of interest and click "View results" in the Experiment Rule of the Feature. Read more about running feature experiments [here](/feature-flag-experiments).

**Importing an Experiment Analysis from your Data Source**

You can also import an analysis directly from your Data Source using your configured Experiment Assignment Source.
If you navigate to the Experiment page in the left toolbar and click Add Experiment, you'll see the following panel.

  alt="Experiment Import Modal"
  style={{ width: 600, margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

On this modal you can either create an experiment using some metadata that we infer from your metric source using the Import buttons on the right hand side.
You can also manually create an experiment from scratch.

## Experiment Configuration

There are several different ways to configure your experiment analysis.

### Experiment Metadata

The top left of the experiment page shows the experiment name, tags description, hypothesis, and variation metadata. You can edit these fields as you see fit to help describe and categorize your experiment.

### Experiment Settings

Here is where much of your experiment analysis is configured. Many of the fields here have some text explaining how they affect your analysis. Here are a few of them in more detail:

**Experiment Id** - This is the key that will be used when filtering your experiment assignment source to query experiment exposure data.

**Activation Metric** - A binomial metric that will filter the users in your analysis to only those who have converted on this binomial metric. This should only be used if activation is expected to be independent of experiment assignment. If an experiment affects the activation metric directly, then there is the potential for bias in your analysis.

**Metric Conversion Windows** - Each user has a conversion window defined by when they were exposed to the experiment. If a user was recently exposed to the experiment, or was exposed near the end of the experiment, they may not have had the full window to convert before the analysis window closes. You may exclude these users with "In-Progress Conversions" if you want your experiment averages to only include those who have had the full window to convert.

**Attribution Model**

Attribution models deal with how we attribute metric values (conversions, counts, any arbitrary value to be aggregated at the unit level) to individual units (e.g. users). They rely on the concept of "conversion windows" which is discussed more in depth on the [Metric documentation page](metrics).

There are 2 **Attribution Models** that experiments can use:

- **First Exposure** uses a single conversion window based on the first time the user sees a particular experiment. The conversion window runs from the exposure timestamp + the conversion delay hours and for however many hours the conversion window is set to. For example, if the delay is 12 hours, and the window is 24 hours, then we will aggregate the metric values for each user from 12-36 hours after their first experiment exposure.
- **Experiment Duration** uses a single conversion window that extends from their first exposure + conversion delay until the end of the experiment or phase. For example, if the delay is 12 hours, then the conversion window will extend from 12 hours after each user is bucketed until the present time or the end of the experiment/phase, if specified.

This table summarizes the two models:

| Attribution Model   | Conversion Window Start                | Conversion Window End                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| First Exposure      | First Exposure Date + Conversion Delay | Conversion Window Start + Conversion Window Length |
| Experiment Duration | First Exposure Date + Conversion Delay | End of Experiment                                  |

Currently, all analyses will use the "First Exposure" model by default. The _Experiment Duration_ model replaced the _All Exposures_ model in early 2023.

### Experiment Metrics

You can add metrics as goal metrics, guardrail metrics, or both. You also can add "Metric Overrides" which provide experiment-specific controls for metrics, allowing you to override the metric's defaults for, for example, conversion windows and risk thresholds.

### Experiment Phases

Experiment Phases can help you filter the dates used in the experiment analysis. Be very careful using phases. If you move the start date of the phase to past the start date of the experiment (and users were not re-randomized across phases), then your analysis could suffer from carryover bias. It is best to always look at the full history of an experiment if possible.

### Making Changes While Running

We allow you make changes to an experiment's targeting while it is running. This is especially useful if you want to start running on a small percent of traffic and then gradually ramp up exposure.

Based on what you are changing, there are two recommended ways to release these changes. The UI should guide you to make the correct recommended choice in most cases, but you are able to change this if desired.

#### Update the existing phase

This modifies the experiment in-place without resetting results or re-randomizing users. This provides the best user experience for your users and you can re-use data that was already collected, which can reduce the time the experiment needs to run.

However, if you're not careful, this can introduce significant bias and data quality issues into your results. A few categories of changes are broadly considered "safe" and if you are only making these changes, this is the approach we recommend going with. The "safe" changes are:

- Increasing the percent of people included in the experiment
- Removing a condition from an experiment (e.g. going from "US visitors only" to "All visitors")
- Removing an experiment from a namespace

All of these changes have something in common - they are simply increasing the number of users exposed to the experiment. There is no affect on existing users in the experiment.

#### Start a new phase

This creates a brand new phase of the experiment. All data collected until this point is excluded from the analysis and you start fresh (nothing is deleted from your data warehouse, we just hide old data from the results).

In addition, there is a recommended toggle to re-randomize traffic. This will cause everyone - including existing experiment users - to get assigned a new random variation. This can be a disruptive user experience since many people will switch from Control to Treatment (or vice versa).

Why would you ever want to do this? Some changes you make completely invalidate past results so this lets you cleanly separate the data analysis from before and after you make the change. Re-randomizing traffic can also eliminate carryover bias and make your results more reliable and accurate.

We recommend this approach for any change that is not considered "safe" (listed above). This can include (but not limited to):

- Changing the traffic split between variations
- Adding a new targeting condition
- Decreasing the percent of people included

Because of how disruptive this can be, it's best to plan ahead before starting an experiment. It's better to start with more conservative targeting and scale up than the reverse (starting big and scaling back).
