GrowthBook DevTools are a Chrome extension that helps you inspect, debug, and modify feature flags and experiments in real time. Whether you're troubleshooting an experiment or tweaking a feature flag, DevTools gives you full visibility and control‚Äîright in your browser.

## Requirements

GrowthBook DevTools is compatible with Chrome, Edge, Arc, and most other browsers that enable Chrome extensions.

It works with most GrowthBook client SDKs, including the HTML Script Tag, JavaScript SDK, and React SDK (client-rendered).

Before using DevTools, ensure your SDK is configured with:

```bash
enableDevMode: true
```

This allows DevTools to connect and display feature flags, experiments, and attributes.

## Installation

GrowthBook DevTools is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/growthbook-devtools/opemhndcehfgipokneipaafbglcecjia). To install:

- Click **Add to Chrome**
- Confirm the installation when prompted

Once installed, GrowthBook DevTools automatically detects and connects to the GrowthBook SDK whenever it‚Äôs active on a website ‚ú®

## Accessing GrowthBook DevTools

GrowthBook DevTools is accessible in two ways. Use whichever best fits your workflow:

### 1. Quick Access

A lightweight view for quick flag and experiment testing.

- Pin the extension to your toolbar (click the puzzle piece üß©, then pin GrowthBook).
- Click the GrowthBook icon to open the popup.

:::tip
A green dot on the GrowthBook icon means DevTools are successfully connected.

### 2. Chrome Developer Tools Panel

Ideal for when you need more space or want to inspect feature flags alongside other Chrome Developer Tools.

- Open Chrome Developer Tools with `Cmd` + `Option` + `I` (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` (Windows/Linux).
- Click the **GrowthBook** tab in the Developer Tools panel. (If it‚Äôs hidden, check the overflow menu ¬ª.)

## Essential Features

GrowthBook DevTools provides powerful debugging and testing tools, including:

- A real-time view of active **feature flags** and **experiments**
- The ability to **override flags and experiment variations**
- A detailed **debug log** explaining how and why flags were evaluated
- Insights into **attributes** affecting feature rollouts
- Syncing **attributes and Archetypes** directly from GrowthBook

### Feature Flags & Overrides

The **Features** tab provides an overview of your feature flags, including their current values and associated experiments (indicated by the flask icon). Click on a feature to open its detail view, where you can:

- Override the current value (flip a boolean, change a string, etc.).
- See why the flag was evaluated the way it was under **Rules and Values**.

:::tip
An orange dot means an override is active.

:::note
All feature flags are shown, even if they weren‚Äôt evaluated on the page. Use the **Hide inactive** toggle to hide these flags.

**Feature flag data table**

| Field                   | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current value           | The feature flag‚Äôs current value. Click or type to override.                             |
| Rules and Values        | All the rules for the flag. Defaults to showing the rule that defines the current value. |
| Debug log               | The reason why the flag was evaluated as such.                                           |
| Full feature definition | The complete JSON definition of the feature flag.                                        |

### Experiments

The **Experiments** tab gives a complete overview of your A/B tests, including how they‚Äôre implemented (feature flag, URL redirect, visual editor) and their current values. Click on an experiment to open its detail view, where you can:

- See additional experiment data.
- Override the assigned variation to test different experiences.

**Experiment data table**

| Field                      | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enrollment Status          | Whether the user is included in the experiment (irrespective of control/variant). |
| Current variation          | Which the user is assigned to. Click another variation to override it.            |
| Results log                | The experiment result object.                                                     |
| Current value              | The value associated with the current variation.                                  |
| Implementation             | How the experiment is implemented: feature flag, visual editor, URL redirect      |
| Targeting and Traffic      | Targeting conditions, traffic/enrollment settings, and URL rules if applicable.   |
| Debug log                  | The reason why the experiment was evaluated as such.                              |
| Full experiment definition | The complete JSON definition of the experiment.                                   |

## Attributes

Experiments and feature flags often depend on **user attributes** (e.g., location, subscription tier). The **Attributes** tab lets you:

- View and edit the attributes the GrowthBook SDK is using.
- Override attributes to test different scenarios (e.g., simulate a Pro user vs. Free user).
- Use **JSON input** for more complex setups.

## Event Logs

When configured in the SDK, Event logs show 3 types of data:

- Feature result logs via [`onFeatureUsage`](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/js#feature-usage-callback).
- Experiment tracking callbacks via [`trackingCallback`](https://docs.growthbook.io/lib/js#feature-flag-experiments).
- Metric events sent via `eventLogger`.

## SDK

The SDK tab provides helpful data about your SDK, including its connection status, along with debug info and resource links if you encounter an issue. Click on each property for additional details and a short description of its function.

Two particularly useful fields for debugging:

1. **Sticky Bucketing** detail shows all sticky buckets for the current user.
2. **SDK Payload** shows the actual payload the SDK is using.

## Advanced Features

GrowthBook DevTools works great out of the box, but if you want even more power, enable advanced features with an Access Token:

- Synced attributes: Brings in all possible attributes and their types from GrowthBook.
- [Archetypes](https://docs.growthbook.io/features/rules#archetype): Toggle between preset user attributes defined in GrowthBook.

To enables these features:

- Click on the cog icon ‚öôÔ∏è
- Add a personal access token. (Use the **Access Token** link to create a token in GrowthBook.)
- If self-hosting, uncheck **GrowthBook Cloud** and enter your API details.
- Click **Save**.

![DevTools Access Token](/images/devtools-pat.webp)

Once saved, open the **Current User** dropdown to apply archetypes to feature flags and experiments. For example, use a **Pro user** archetype to test how your site behaves with premium features unlocked, or a **New user** archetype to see the experience for first-time visitors.

## Visual Editor

GrowthBook DevTools also powers our Visual Editor, which enables designing A/B tests without writing code. The Visual Editor requires the Access Token mentioned in the previous section. See the docs [on the Visual Editor.](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/visual)
