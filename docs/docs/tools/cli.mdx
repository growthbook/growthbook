## CLI Features

### Generating Types

The GrowthBook CLI enables you to generate TypeScript types for working with the SDK.

Run `growthbook features generate-types --help` for more info.

See the [JavaScript SDK documentation &rarr; Strongly-typed feature definitions](/lib/js#strongly-typed-feature-definitions) for more information on working with typed features.

### Profile management

If you have multiple GrowthBook organizations or accounts, you can easily switch between profiles when running individual commands.

Run `growthbook auth --help` for more info.

## Usage

### Installing the CLI

You can install the CLI to your project with the following command:

    npm install growthbook --save

Or if you use `yarn` you can do:

    yarn add growthbook

You can also install it globally so you can use it with multiple projects and outside of projects:

    npm install -g growthbook

The `growthbook` executable should now be available in your project. You should now be able to run commands, e.g.:

    growthbook --help

### Adding your API secret

Before using the GrowthBook CLI you will need to authenticate yourself. You will need to get an API key, which you can do [here <ExternalLink />](https://app.growthbook.io/settings/keys).

Next, use the `growthbook auth login --apiKey XXX` command to set your token for the default profile.

Run `growthbook auth login --help` for more info and options.

### Generating Types

You can also add it to your `package.json` file of the project that will use the types, e.g.:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "type-gen": "growthbook features generate-types --output ./types"
  }
}
```

It should now be available for use when you run `npm run type-gen` or `yarn type-gen`.

### Detailed Command Usage

See the generated [GrowthBook CLI command documentation on Github <ExternalLink />](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-cli#commands).
