The GrowthBook command-line interface (CLI) is a tool for working with the GrowthBook A/B testing, feature flagging, and experimentation platform.

Requires Node.js version 16+.

:::success New

The GrowthBook CLI is a brand new tool. If you experience any issues, let us know either on [Slack](https://slack.growthbook.io/) or [create an issue](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-cli/issues).

## CLI Features

### Generating Types

The GrowthBook CLI enables you to generate TypeScript types for working with the SDK.

Run `growthbook features generate-types --help` for more info.

See the [JavaScript SDK documentation](/lib/js#strict-typing) for more information on working with typed features.

### Profile management

If you have multiple GrowthBook organizations or accounts, you can easily switch between profiles when running individual commands.

Run `growthbook auth --help` for more info.

## Usage

### Installing the CLI

You can install the CLI to your project with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install growthbook --save
```

You can also install it globally so you can use it with multiple projects and outside of projects:

```bash
npm install -g growthbook
```

The `growthbook` executable should now be available in your project. You should now be able to run commands, e.g.:

```bash
growthbook --help
```

### Adding your API secret

Before using the GrowthBook CLI you will need to authenticate yourself. You will need to get an API key, which you can do [here <ExternalLink />](https://app.growthbook.io/settings/keys).

Next, use the `growthbook auth login --apiKey XXX` command to set your token for the default profile.

Run `growthbook auth login --help` for more info and options.

### Generating Types

You can also add it to your `package.json` file of the project that will use the types, e.g.:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "type-gen": "growthbook features generate-types --output ./types"
  }
}
```

It should now be available for use when you run `npm run type-gen` or `yarn type-gen`.

### Usage on CI/CD

If you'd like to use the CLI in continuous integration/continuous deployment environments, instead of running the `growthbook auth login` command, we recommend creating the following file at `~/.growthbook/config.toml` with your secret and API base URL:

```toml
[default]
growthbook_secret = "secret_abc123"
api_base_url = "https://api.growthbook.io" # replace this with your API URL if self-hosted
```

You can also store multiple profiles and refer to them with the `--profile` flag in supported commands:

```toml
[default]
growthbook_secret = "secret_abc123"
api_base_url = "https://api.growthbook.io"

[acme_donuts]
growthbook_secret = "secret_xyz987"
api_base_url = "http://localhost:3100"
```

### Detailed Command Usage

See the generated [GrowthBook CLI command documentation on Github <ExternalLink />](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-cli#commands).
