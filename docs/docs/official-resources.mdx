<CommercialFeature feature="manage-official-resources" />

Official Resources are protected resources that **can only be modified by users with appropriate permissions**. These resources have a checkmark badge in the app to indicate their protected status. This feature is useful for resources that are externally managed or need to remain consistent across teams.

## Use Cases

Official Resources are particularly useful for:

- **Governance**: Organizations want to prevent unauthorized changes to critical resources
- **External System Management**: Resources are managed by external systems (like a version control system)
- **Cross-Project Consistency**: Resources need to be identical across multiple projects
- **Compliance**: Resources must be managed through specific, auditable processes

## Official Resource Types

- Fact Tables
- Fact Metrics
- Fact Filters
- Segments
- Dimensions

## 3 Ways to Create Official Resources

### 1. GrowthBook UI

Create Official Resources in-app by marking them as "Official" during creation. Only users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy can apply this designation.

### 2. REST API

When creating resources via the REST API, use the optional `managedBy` property:

- **`managedBy: "api"`**: The resource is not editable in the app but can be modified via the REST API. This is ideal for resources managed by external repositories or systems.
- **`managedBy: "admin"`**: The resource can be modified in the app or via the REST API, but only by users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy.

###3. config.yml

When resources are created via the `config.yml` file, they are automatically marked as "Official" and are not editable in the app. To make changes to these resources, you must update the `config.yml` file.

:::note Restrictions on creating Official Resources

Currently only Segments, and Dimensions can be created via the `config.yml` file, Fact Tables, Fact Metrics, and Fact Filters can only be created via the UI or REST API.

## Managing Official Resources

### Marking Existing Resources as Official

Users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy can mark existing resources as Official in the app, which prevents other users from modifying these resources.

### Unmarking Resources as Official

Removing the "Official" status from a resource is possible for users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy, but the process depends on how the resource was created.

- If a resource was created via the `config.yml` file, it cannot be unmarked as "Official." Instead, you must remove the resource from the `config.yml` file, and then create a new version of the resource in the app or via the API.
- If a resource was created via the REST API and has `managedBy: "api"`, you will need to update the resource via the REST API and remove the `managedBy` property.
- If a resource was created in the app or via the REST API (and has `managedBy: "admin"`), it can be unmarked as "Official" in the app or via the REST API.

:::note Limited support for marking Official Resources

At this time, only `Fact Metrics`, and `Fact Tables` can be marked or unmarked as "Official" in the app. We are actively working on adding this feature to other resource types.

### Required Permissions

To manage Official Resources, users need the `ManageOfficialResources` policy. By default, this policy is only available to users with the `admin` role. However, Enterprise organizations can create custom roles and assign the `ManageOfficialResources` policy to them.

For more information about roles and permissions, see [User Permissions](/account/user-permissions).
