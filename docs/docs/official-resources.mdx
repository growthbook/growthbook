# Official Resources

Official Resources in GrowthBook are resources that have been marked as "Official" and cannot be modified via the GrowthBook UI by users without the appropriate permissions. This feature is useful for resources that are managed by external systems or need to be consistent across multiple projects.

## Use Cases

Official Resources are particularly useful when:

- **External System Management**: Resources are managed by external systems (like data warehouses or CI/CD pipelines)
- **Cross-Project Consistency**: Resources need to be identical across multiple projects
- **Governance**: Organizations want to prevent unauthorized changes to critical resources
- **Compliance**: Resources must be managed through specific, auditable processes

## What GrowthBook Resources can be marked as official?

The following resource types can be marked as Official:

- Fact Tables
- Fact Metrics
- Fact Filters
- Legacy Metrics
- Segments
- Dimensions

## How do I create an Official Resource?

GrowthBook provides three ways to create Official Resources:

### Via config.yml

When resources are created via the `config.yml` file, they are automatically marked as "Official" by default and are not editable via the GrowthBook UI. To make changes to these resources, you must update the `config.yml` file.

### Via REST API

When creating resources via the REST API, you can use the optional `managedBy` property:

- **`managedBy: "api"`** - The resource is not editable via the GrowthBook UI but can be modified via the REST API. This is ideal for resources managed by external repositories or systems.
- **`managedBy: "admin"`** - The resource can be modified via the GrowthBook UI or REST API, but only by users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy.

### Via GrowthBook UI

Resources can be created via the GrowthBook UI and marked as "Official" at the time of creation. Only users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy can mark resources as Official.

## Managing Official Resources

### Marking existing resources as Official

Users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy can mark existing resources as Official via the UI. This prevents other users from modifying these resources through the GrowthBook UI.

### Unmarking resources as Official

Removing the "Official" status from a resource is possible for users with the `ManageOfficialResources` policy, but the process is different depending on how the resource was created.

- If a resource was created via the `config.yml` file, it cannot be unmarked as "Official". Instead, you must remove the resource from the `config.yml` file, and then create a new version of the resource via the UI or the API.
- If a resource was created via the REST API, and has `managedBy: "api"`, you will need to update the resource via the REST API and remove the `managedBy` property.
- If a resource was created via the GrowthBook UI or the REST API, and has `managedBy: "admin"`, it can be unmarked as "Official" via the UI or the REST API.

:::note

At this time, only `Legacy Metrics` can be marked or unmarked as "Official" via the GrowthBook UI. We are actively working on adding this feature to other resource types.

### Required Permissions

To manage Official Resources, users need the `ManageOfficialResources` policy. By default, this policy is only available to users with the `admin` role. However, Enterprise organizations can create custom roles and assign the `ManageOfficialResources` policy to them.

For more information about roles and permissions, see [User Permissions](/account/user-permissions).
