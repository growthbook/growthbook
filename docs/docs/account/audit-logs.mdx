GrowthBook keeps an audit log of all actions taken on the platform. You can access this page from the Settings â†’ Log in the left navigation.

<div style={{textAlign: "center", paddingBottom: "10px"}}>
  <img src="/images/using/audit-logs.png" alt="Audit log page" style={{maxWidth: "600px"}} />
</div>

These logs are useful for auditing what users have done, and figuring out the cause of any issues. These logs are not user editable.
For enterprise customers, this log is exportable. We have more filtering options coming soon.
