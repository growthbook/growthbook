Fine-tuning user permissions in an application like GrowthBook ensures a tailored experience, empowering organizations to grant precisely defined access levels. This granular control not only enhances security but also enables teams to collaborate efficiently while safeguarding sensitive features or data.

Organizations using GrowthBook have a number of different ways of defining a user's permission level, depending on the organization's plan.

Regardless of the plan, all organizations can assign a global role when inviting a user which defines their permissions across all projects. If you have a Pro or Enterprise account, you can also assign project-level roles for each user.

:::note

For example, you can assign a user the global role of `Collaborator`, allowing them to view features and experiments, add comments, and contribute ideas. You can then assign them an `Experimenter` role for a specific project, which allows them to create and run experiments, but only for that project.

:::

And, for our Enterprise organizations, we offer the ability to create `Teams`, which are groups of users, all of which inherit the roles and permissions of the Team they're on.

The table below lists the roles available in GrowthBook and their associated permissions.

#### Environment Specific Limits

![Environment Specific Limits](/images/user-permissions-env-specific.png)

GrowthBook's user permissions also include environment specific limits. This permission level applies only to `Engineer` and `Experimenter` roles in Pro or Enterprise accounts. It allows you to limit the feature flags and experiments a user can manage to specific environments. For example, you can allow an `Engineer` to create and run experiments in a staging environment, but not in production.

#### How permissions are evaluated

GrowthBook evaluates user permissions based on whether an action is taking place within a specific project. If so, project-level permissions are checked first, followed by the user's global role. If the action is not within a project, only the user's global role is checked.

For organizations without a Pro or Enterprise account, user permissions are evaluated solely based on their global role.

:::note

If your organization has enabled the setting to allow verified users to automatically join your organization, they will receive the `Collaborator` role by default when they join. However, you can change your organizations' default role at the bottom of the Team page.

:::

### Teams

Enterprise organizations using GrowthBook can create Teams with distinct capabilities. When setting up a Team, you have the option to define both a global role and project-level roles, much like how you do for individual users. Once a Team is established, multiple users can be added to it. Any user added to a Team will automatically inherit all permissions assigned to that Team. This feature becomes particularly useful when combined with [GrowthBook's SCIM integration](https://docs.growthbook.io/integrations/scim), enabling automated user provisioning and de-provisioning.

To create a Team, you can go to `Settings` > `Team` via the Sidebar and then select the `Teams` tab at the top of the page. Here, you can create and configure various Teams, before adding members to a Team. When evaluating whether or not a user has permission to perform a certain action, we will merge the user's permissions with the permissions inherited from all the Teams the user is on. So if the user's global role is `Collaborator` but they're on a Team that grants them `Engineer` permissions, that user's permission will then be a merger of the `Collaborator` and `Engineer` roles.
