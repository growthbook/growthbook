GrowthBook supports user roles and permissions at both the global and project level. This allows you to control who can access GrowthBook and what they can do.

When inviting a new user to your organization, you can give the user a global role, which defines their permissions across all projects. If you are enrolled in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account, you
have the added ability to give a user project-level roles.

:::note

For instance, you can set a user's global role as `Collaborator`, which allows them to view features and experiements, as well as add
comments and contribute ideas, and then give them an `Experimenter` role for a particular project, which allows them to create and run experiments, but only for the specified project.

:::

Below are the roles currently available in GrowthBook.

- `readonly` - This role allows the user to view nearly all areas of the application, including Feature Flags, Experiments, Metrics, Dimensions, Segments, Data Sources, and more. However, they can't make any edits, nor are they able to access or edit organizational settings like inviting team members, adding/editing API keys, or projects.
- `collaborator` - This role inherits all of the permissions of a `readonly` user, while allowing the user to add comments to features and experiments and contribute ideas.
- `engineer` - This role inherits all of the permissions of a `collaborator` user, while also allowing the user to create and edit feature flags, but not experiments.
- `analyst` - This role inherits all of the permissions of a `collaborator` user, while also allowing the user to create and edit experiments, but not feature flags. Analysts can also create/edit metrics and dimensions.
- `experimenter` - This role inherits all of the permissions of a `collaborator`, while also allowing the user to create and edit both feature flags and experiments. Experimenters can also create/edit metrics, dimensions, and segments.
- `admin` - This allows the user to manage all aspects of GrowthBook, including updating plans and billing, inviting and removing team members, setting up projects, API keys, and more. Admins can also create/edit Data Sources

#### Environment Specific Limits

And finally, there is one last level to GrowthBook's user permissions, which determines environment specific limits. This permission level only applies to `engineer` and `experimenter` roles in organizations in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account. This
allows you to limit the feature flags and experiments a user can manage to particular environments. For instance, you can allow and engineer to create and run experiments in a `staging` environment, but not in `production`.

#### How permissions are evaluated

When evaluating whether or not a user has permissions to perform a certain action, GrowthBook will check if the action is taking place within a particular project, and if so, we'll check their project-level permissions first, before falling back to
the user's global role. If the action is not taking place within a project, we'll just check the user's global role.

If your organization is not enrolled in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account, we will simply evaluate the user's permission level via their global role.

:::note

If your organization has enabled the setting to allow verified users to automatically join your organization, when they join, they will automatically receive the `collaborator` role.
