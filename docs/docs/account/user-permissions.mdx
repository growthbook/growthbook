GrowthBook supports user roles and permissions at both the global and project level. This allows you to control who can access GrowthBook and what they can do.

When inviting a new user to your organization, you can give the user a global role, which defines their permissions across all projects. If you are enrolled in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account, you
have the added ability to give a user project-level roles.

:::note

For instance, you can set a user's global role as `Collaborator`, which allows them to view features and experiements, as well as add
comments and contribute ideas, and then give them an `Experimenter` role for a particular project, which allows them to create and run experiments, but only for the specified project.

:::

Below are the roles currently available in GrowthBook, ordered from least permissive to most. Each additional level inherits all of the permissions from the roles below it.

- `readonly` - This role allows the user to view feature flags and experiments, but not make any changes.
- `collaborator` - This role allows the user to view feature flags and experiments, as well as add comments and contribute ideas.
- `engineer` - This role allows the user to manage feature flags, but not experiments.
- `analyst` - This allows the user to analyze experiments.
- `experimenter` - This allows the user to create feature flags and run experiments.
- `admin` - This allows the user to manage all aspects of GrowthBook, including billing, organizational settings, and team members.

And finally, there is one last level to GrowthBook's user permissions, which determines environment specific limits. This permission level only applies to `engineer` and `experimenter` roles in organizations in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account. This
allows you to limit the feature flags and experiments a user can manage to particular environments. For instance, you can allow and engineer to create and run experiments in a `staging` environment, but not in `production`.

When evaluating whether or not a user has permissions to perform a certain action, GrowthBook will check if the action is taking place within a particular project, and if so, we'll check their project-level permissions first, before falling back to
the user's global role. If the action is not taking place within a project, we'll just check the user's global role.

If your organization is not enrolled in a `Pro` or `Enterprise` account, we will simply evaluate the user's permission level via their global role.
