## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all sizes, and especially to the Docs. To start working on the docs, you can either edit the markdown files directly in GitHub, or clone the repo and run the docs locally.
To get the docs running locally, you can follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Docs are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and are written in markdown. The docs are located in the `docs/docs` directory.

To run the docs locally, first `cd docs`. If this is the first time you're running the docs, you'll need to run `yarn install` to install the packages. Once the packages are installed, run `yarn dev` to start the docs server. The docs will be available at http://localhost:3200.  You can also consider running `yarn build` which will ask Docusaurus to run more tests.
