By submitting a Contribution, You grant GrowthBook a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by the combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

This patent license shall terminate with respect to any Contribution upon the earlier of:

If Your Contribution includes or relies on any third-party materials, including but not limited to libraries, code, or design elements, You must identify such third-party materials and the licenses under which they are provided. You also agree to inform GrowthBook of any third-party licenses, patents, or trademarks of which You are aware that relate to Your Contribution.

### 5. No Warranty

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support.
