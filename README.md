## Our Philosophy

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours building their own A/B testing platforms in-house.
The other 99% are left paying for expensive 3rd party SaaS tools or hacking together unmaintained open source libraries.

GrowthBook gives you the flexibility and power of a fully-featured in-house A/B testing platform without needing to build it yourself.
