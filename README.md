## Our Philosophy

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours building their own feature flagging and A/B testing platforms in-house.
The other 99% are left paying for expensive 3rd party SaaS tools or hacking together unmaintained open source libraries.

We want to give all companies the flexibility and power of a fully-featured in-house platform without needing to build it themselves.
